sample-000050.wav,I MAKE MY LIVING FORECASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID
sample-000051.wav,NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND
sample-000052.wav,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
sample-000053.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sample-000054.wav,ALL THEY THINK ABOUT IS FOOD AND WATER
sample-000055.wav,SHAKESPEARE NEVER SAID THAT
sample-000056.wav,YOU NEED TO SEE THIS
sample-000057.wav,THE BOY KNEW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CITY

sample-000062.wav,HE'S THE MAN THE ADS ARE WRITTEN FOR
sample-000063.wav,THERE WAS NO EXCUSE FOR GOODMAN TO FLY OFF THE HANDLE
sample-000064.wav,THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
sample-000065.wav,I TOLD YOU TO HAVE THE ICE BOX FIXED
sample-000066.wav,IT'S LATE IN THE EVENING A PERFECT TIME FOR COFFEE
sample-000067.wav,I'M COMING FATIMA HE SAID

sample-000071.wav,HE THOUGHT OF ALL THE MARRIED SHEPHERDS HE HAD KNOWN
sample-000072.wav,YOU MEAN SPIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
sample-000073.wav,BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHEAR FOUR SHEEP
sample-000074.wav,I JUST GOT RID OF ONE CROWD
sample-000075.wav,EVERY SEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGINNER'S LUCK
sample-000076.wav,YOU CAN'T BE THE WIND THE WIND SAID
sample-000077.wav,HE HAD SURPRISED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT
sample-000078.wav,HE WAS GOING TO MISS THE PLACE AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS HE HAD LEARNED
sample-000079.wav,AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
sample-000080.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sample-000081.wav,IT'S CANDICE NOW ON LONG DISTANCE FROM WASHINGTON
sample-000082.wav,HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD
sample-000083.wav,THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS
sample-000084.wav,DO YOU KNOW WHAT
sample-000085.wav,THEY WENT IN TO DRINK THE TEA WHICH WAS SERVED IN BEAUTIFUL CRYSTAL GLASSES
sample-000086.wav,THIS IS FOR YOU
sample-000087.wav,THEY WERE MEN OF THE DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF SORCERERS
sample-000088.wav,THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
sample-000089.wav,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
sample-000090.wav,AREN'T YOU GOING TO TELL ME
sample-000091.wav,THAT'S TRUE THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-000092.wav,WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
sample-000093.wav,DURING ONE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THE DRIVER TOLD OF HIS OWN LIFE

sample-000095.wav,HE REMEMBERED SOMETHING HIS GRANDFATHER HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT BUTTERFLIES WERE A GOOD OMEN
sample-000096.wav,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-000097.wav,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
sample-000098.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
sample-000099.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-000100.wav,IT KNEW OF THE BOY'S TALK WITH THE DESERT BECAUSE THE WINDS KNOW EVERYTHING
sample-000101.wav,ALL THEY THINK ABOUT IS FOOD AND WATER
sample-000102.wav,AFTER THE DICTATOR'S RULE OF FOURTY THREE YEARS WAS OVER THE COUNTRY WAS DEVASTATED
sample-000103.wav,ONLY WHEN HE CONSENTS
sample-000104.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER WAS SEATED AT THE BASE OF A PALM TREE OBSERVING THE SUNSET
sample-000105.wav,ALL THEY EVER DO REALLY IS LOOK FOR FOOD AND WATER
sample-000106.wav,SURE YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO IN WITH YOU
sample-000107.wav,I WANT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
sample-000108.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-000109.wav,SOME STORMS ARE WORTH THE WRECKAGE
sample-000110.wav,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
sample-000111.wav,MODERN SEWING MACHINES CAN THROTTLE THEIR SPEED
sample-000112.wav,IT'S AS MUCH MY FAULT AS YOURS
sample-000113.wav,IMAGE REGISTRATION COULD BE EASILY INCORPORATED INTO LOWPOWER EMBEDDED DEVICES
sample-000114.wav,THE MERCHANTS WERE ASSEMBLING THEIR STALLS AND THE BOY HELPED A CANDY SELLER TO DO HIS
sample-000115.wav,YOU DON'T DENY THAT
sample-000116.wav,THEY MADE THE BOY CONTINUE DIGGING BUT HE FOUND NOTHING
sample-000117.wav,THEN HE SAT IN THE SUNFILLED DOORWAY SMOKING THE HOOKAH
sample-000118.wav,ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sample-000119.wav,IT SAID THAT THE DARKEST HOUR OF THE NIGHT CAME JUST BEFORE THE DAWN

sample-000121.wav,I CAN'T LET YOU HAVE MY PLANE
sample-000122.wav,IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL
sample-000123.wav,HE PUT HIS HEADCLOTH IN PLACE AND SECURED IT WITH A RING MADE OF CAMEL SKIN
sample-000124.wav,MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sample-000125.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN ASKED IF THEY WERE IN DANGER
sample-000126.wav,SUN IS BETTER THAN RAIN
sample-000127.wav,THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
sample-000128.wav,YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
sample-000129.wav,IT'S THE MASTER WORK OF THE ALCHEMISTS
sample-000130.wav,THEY WENT ON SMOKING THE PIPE FOR A WHILE AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SET
sample-000131.wav,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sample-000132.wav,FROM HERE ON YOU WILL BE ALONE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sample-000133.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-000134.wav,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
sample-000135.wav,SOMETIMES I GET SO MAD AT YOU I CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT
sample-000136.wav,ON OUR WAY TO SAN FRANCISCO WE WERE LISTENING TO REGGAE MUSIC AND SMOKING WEED
sample-000137.wav,WORK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
sample-000138.wav,MANY OF OUR SOLDIERS TEAMED UP
sample-000139.wav,AM I GOING TO FIND MY TREASURE HE ASKED
sample-000140.wav,HELIUM MAKES YOUR VOICE HIGH PITCHED
sample-000141.wav,IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sample-000142.wav,THE BOY CLOSED HIS BOOK
sample-000143.wav,YOU MEAN THE ONE WHO DRANK SO MUCH
sample-000144.wav,THIS IS NO PLACE FOR YOU
sample-000145.wav,MRS SARAH DOESN'T EITHER
sample-000146.wav,HIS EXPRESSION REMINDED ME OF A HORSE CHEWING HAY
sample-000147.wav,ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sample-000148.wav,NATURALLY WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
sample-000149.wav,MAKE SURE YOU'VE READ MY INTRODUCTORY POST ON VOICE CODING SINCE WE WILL BE BUILDING UPON THAT
sample-000150.wav,HE TOLD FATIMA THAT AT THEIR NEXT MEETING
sample-000151.wav,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sample-000152.wav,MAYBE THE WATER WAS TOO HOT
sample-000153.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sample-000154.wav,HE REALLY WAS A KING A WISE KING
sample-000155.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sample-000156.wav,HE NEEDS THREE DAYS ANSWERED THE ALCHEMIST
sample-000157.wav,THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
sample-000158.wav,IT WAS THE FIRST TIME EITHER HAD TOUCHED THE OTHER
sample-000159.wav,I'M LEAVING RIGHT NOW
sample-000160.wav,THEN CONNECT TO LOCALHOST WITHIN WINDOWS
sample-000161.wav,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
sample-000162.wav,THE BOY CLOSED HIS BOOK
sample-000163.wav,I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
sample-000164.wav,THE CHAIR LIFT TOOK THEM UP THE MOUNTAIN
sample-000165.wav,SOMEBODY HAD RETURNED MY LOST CREDIT CARD TO THE BANK
sample-000166.wav,BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
sample-000167.wav,THAT DOESN'T SAY MUCH FOR MINE
sample-000168.wav,DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
sample-000169.wav,JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
sample-000170.wav,HOW AM I GOING TO LIVE UNTIL THE BANK OPENS
sample-000171.wav,LIZ PUT THE FLOWERS INTO A MIRRORED VASE
sample-000172.wav,HE PREPARED HIMSELF A SANDWICH AND DRANK SOME HOT TEA FROM A CRYSTAL GLASS
sample-000173.wav,PROMISE YOU'LL NEVER LIE THE WAY SNOOPY DID
sample-000174.wav,THERE IS NO WINE IN THIS COUNTRY THE YOUNG MAN SAID
sample-000175.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sample-000176.wav,THEN SHE TOOK BOTH OF HIS HANDS IN HERS AND BEGAN QUIETLY TO PRAY
sample-000177.wav,YOU'D THINK I WAS ON THE WITNESS STAND
sample-000178.wav,THE EMERALD TABLET IS A DIRECT PASSAGE TO THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
sample-000179.wav,I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU
sample-000180.wav,THIS IS FOR YOU
sample-000181.wav,MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
sample-000182.wav,JUST GIVE ME A FEW HOURS BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY DECISIONS
sample-000183.wav,AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED
sample-000184.wav,IN ONE HE HAD READ THAT MANY YEARS AGO A FAMOUS ARABIAN ALCHEMIST HAD VISITED EUROPE
sample-000185.wav,ONE IS LOVED BECAUSE ONE IS LOVED
sample-000186.wav,THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES
sample-000187.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
sample-000188.wav,I'D HATE TO HAVE THAT MANY PINS STUCK IN ME
sample-000189.wav,I MET A MAN WITH SHARP NAILS
sample-000190.wav,ONLY THE LIGHTS IN THE GREAT TENT REMAINED
sample-000191.wav,APPARENTLY IT'S THE DUMPLINGS THAT MAKE THIS STEW TASTE SO GOOD
sample-000192.wav,WHEN SHE SAW THE UNKNOWN OBJECT BOBBING UP AND DOWN THE EDGE SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED
sample-000193.wav,I HAVE KNOWN TRUE ALCHEMISTS THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED
sample-000194.wav,HE REALLY WAS A KING A WISE KING
sample-000195.wav,WHAT ARE THESE THINGS HE ASKED
sample-000196.wav,I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
sample-000197.wav,I NEVER SAW IT BEFORE
sample-000198.wav,I'M PROUD OF IT
sample-000199.wav,THE BOY WAS EMBARRASSED AND CONFESSED THAT HE HAD OBSERVED NOTHING
sample-000200.wav,THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
sample-000201.wav,HE LEFT WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE TO THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
sample-000202.wav,A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
sample-000203.wav,A FINE BUNCH OF REPORTERS
sample-000204.wav,THE BOY WAS STARTLED
sample-000205.wav,SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHT SAY IT TRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND
sample-000206.wav,EVERYONE ON EARTH HAS A TREASURE THAT AWAITS HIM HIS HEART SAID
sample-000207.wav,IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
sample-000208.wav,WHAT ABOUT THIS JOB
sample-000209.wav,WHAT IS AN ALCHEMIST HE ASKED FINALLY
sample-000210.wav,AND THEIR EYES SPOKE OF DEATH
sample-000211.wav,THE ALCHEMIST IS TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD THE ENGLISHMAN HAD TOLD HIM
sample-000212.wav,HE RECITED AN OUR FATHER SILENTLY
sample-000213.wav,I'M GOING TO FIND KYLE'S MOTHER
sample-000214.wav,I WOULD HAVE WON THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS IF NOT FOR THOSE MEDALING KIDS
sample-000215.wav,HIS HANDS BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE WOMAN SENSED IT
sample-000216.wav,GIVE IT TO ME
sample-000217.wav,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sample-000218.wav,THE SUNSET FADED INTO TWILIGHT BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE HAPPENED
sample-000219.wav,THE BOY BEGAN TO DIG INTO THE DUNE
sample-000220.wav,THIS IS WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE EMERALD TABLET SAID THE ALCHEMIST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED
sample-000221.wav,SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sample-000222.wav,AN ARMY IS COMING THE BOY SAID
sample-000223.wav,I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
sample-000224.wav,THE BOY WAS GETTING IRRITATED
sample-000225.wav,YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM YOUR HEART
sample-000226.wav,THE FIRST DAY PASSED
sample-000227.wav,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
sample-000228.wav,I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
sample-000229.wav,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
sample-000230.wav,BUT HIS HEART WAS SPEAKING OF OTHER THINGS
sample-000231.wav,WHAT IF YOU CAN'T STAND HIM
sample-000232.wav,THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
sample-000233.wav,BRENT'S OPENING ATTACK ON THE GOVERNOR

sample-000236.wav,I'M SMOKING TOO MUCH
sample-000237.wav,I KNOW YOU'RE UNHAPPY
sample-000238.wav,OTHERS STUMBLED UPON THE STONE BY ACCIDENT
sample-000239.wav,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sample-000240.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN SAID NOTHING
sample-000241.wav,BECAUSE WE'RE THE PEOPLE AND WE'RE TOUGH
sample-000242.wav,AND HE KNEW WHAT WAS THE FAIR PRICE FOR EVERY ONE OF HIS ANIMALS
sample-000243.wav,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sample-000244.wav,JUPITER HAS A GREAT RED SPOT
sample-000245.wav,THEN YOU TAUGHT ME SOMETHING OF THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AND THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
sample-000246.wav,I HAVEN'T ANY WATCH

sample-000248.wav,THEN WHERE IS YOUR GUN
sample-000249.wav,AND ONE CAN ALWAYS COME BACK
sample-000250.wav,THIS BISCUIT IS YUMMY
sample-000251.wav,HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
sample-000252.wav,THE HEAT LASTED UNTIL NIGHTFALL AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD TO CARRY HIS JACKET
sample-000253.wav,MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sample-000254.wav,THOSE ARE THE RULES OF WAR THE LEADER EXPLAINED
sample-000255.wav,IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
sample-000256.wav,THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sample-000257.wav,I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND
sample-000258.wav,THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sample-000259.wav,CALIBRATION COMPLETE
sample-000260.wav,SHE REFILLED HER VESSEL AND LEFT
sample-000261.wav,THAT BRINGS YOU GOOD LUCK FOR TEN YEARS
sample-000262.wav,THE BOY REMEMBERED AN OLD PROVERB FROM HIS COUNTRY
sample-000263.wav,YOU CAN HEAR OUT OF IT
sample-000264.wav,NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IT'S A NICE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE YOU'RE GETTING FROM YOUR BOSS
sample-000265.wav,THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
sample-000266.wav,IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TALKING TO HIS SHEEP
sample-000267.wav,WHEN THE SUN SETS THE MEN WILL ONCE AGAIN SURRENDER THEIR ARMS TO ME
sample-000268.wav,HE HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE SOMEONE AS CAPABLE AS HIS PREVIOUS APPRENTICE
sample-000269.wav,I WOULD HAVE WON THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS IF NOT FOR THOSE MEDALING KIDS
sample-000270.wav,THE BOY REMEMBERED AN OLD PROVERB FROM HIS COUNTRY

sample-000274.wav,ALTHOUGH EVERYTHING SHOULD BE UNDER THE STATE'S CONTROL THERE IS A LOT OF VIOLENCE IN PRISONS
sample-000275.wav,HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
sample-000276.wav,HE WAS PLANNING AS HE LEFT THE BAR
sample-000277.wav,I GET THIRTY DOLLARS A WEEK
sample-000278.wav,DID SHE DISCUSS IT WITH YOU
sample-000279.wav,THE COTTAGE BURNED DOWN
sample-000280.wav,I AM HERE THE BOY SAID
sample-000281.wav,AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sample-000282.wav,I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
sample-000283.wav,THE PATH THROUGH THE FOREST WAS UNLIT AND SCARY
sample-000284.wav,THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sample-000285.wav,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
sample-000286.wav,THE MAN WAS SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE OF ALCHEMY
sample-000287.wav,HE SUGGESTED THAT THE BOY LOOK AROUND THE PALACE AND RETURN IN TWO HOURS
sample-000288.wav,A DROUGHT HIT WESTERN EUROPE
sample-000289.wav,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sample-000290.wav,THE WAR CONTINUED AND AT TIMES THE WIND CARRIED THE SWEET SICKLY SMELL OF BLOOD
sample-000291.wav,I SAY WE DON'T GO OUT ANY MORE
sample-000292.wav,THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS OGILVY AND HENDERSON HAD LEFT IT
sample-000293.wav,THEY'RE ONLY MADE OF ROCK CRYSTAL AND THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ROCK CRYSTALS IN THE EARTH
sample-000294.wav,HE WAS ABLE TO GET ON HIS KNEES BUT HE QUICKLY SLIPPED BACK
sample-000295.wav,TEN YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY AND HERE I AM IN A CORRAL
sample-000296.wav,THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
sample-000297.wav,FROM THEN ON HE WOULD MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS
sample-000298.wav,THE SCABBARD WAS EMBOSSED IN SILVER AND THE HANDLE WAS BLACK AND ENCRUSTED WITH PRECIOUS STONES
sample-000299.wav,A TOUCH OF COLIC
sample-000300.wav,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sample-000301.wav,I SHOULD THANK YOU
sample-000302.wav,I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD WORK ON THIS PROJECT WITH ME BECAUSE I CANT FIND ANYONE ELSE
sample-000303.wav,THAT NIGHT HE TOLD ALL OF THIS TO THE ALCHEMIST
sample-000304.wav,THE STRANGER PLACED HIS SWORD IN ITS SCABBARD AND THE BOY RELAXED
sample-000305.wav,ANOTHER WHO WAS SEARCHING THE BOY'S BAGS FOUND THE PIECE OF GOLD
sample-000306.wav,THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
sample-000307.wav,BUT SHE SAID NOTHING
sample-000308.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sample-000309.wav,AND I TOLD HARRY I THOUGHT I'D BE BORED TO DEATH
sample-000310.wav,AND I STILL CLAIM I WAS RIGHT THE NIGHT I PROPOSED
sample-000311.wav,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
sample-000312.wav,I HAD NEVER HEARD OF ALCHEMISTS BEFORE THE BOY SAID
sample-000313.wav,A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sample-000314.wav,THIS IS WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE EMERALD TABLET SAID THE ALCHEMIST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED
sample-000315.wav,HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
sample-000316.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
sample-000317.wav,THE GIRAFFE HAD BECOME FEARFUL
sample-000318.wav,IT'S STILL SOPPING WET
sample-000319.wav,AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY
sample-000320.wav,ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sample-000321.wav,SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
sample-000322.wav,WITH A BAG OF MARSHMALLOWS
sample-000323.wav,IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
sample-000324.wav,I WANT THOSE STAMPS
sample-000325.wav,MAYBE BECAUSE THAT WASN'T REALLY HIS DREAM
sample-000326.wav,IT WAS SHREDDED LIKE LACE AFTER AN ATTACK FROM HYPERACTIVE KITTENS
sample-000327.wav,ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
sample-000328.wav,NOW THE MOON'S OUT
sample-000329.wav,FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
sample-000330.wav,BUT I'LL MAKE YOU AND MARIA A BUSINESS PROPOSITION
sample-000331.wav,I GOT IT ALL READY
sample-000332.wav,I WANTED THEM TO BE A PART OF YOUR INHERITANCE
sample-000333.wav,THE CITY WAS STILL SLEEPING
sample-000334.wav,IT WAS RISING SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY OUT OF THE CYLINDER
sample-000335.wav,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sample-000336.wav,BUT BEFORE I GO I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY
sample-000337.wav,I DIDN'T FIND THE BLOWDRYER SO I JUST USED THE VACUUMCLEANER
sample-000338.wav,I WON'T SHUT UP
sample-000339.wav,AND I'M CERTAIN YOU'LL FIND IT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sample-000340.wav,I COULD DIE HAPPILY AND THAT MADE ME FEEL GOOD
sample-000341.wav,THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sample-000342.wav,AND THERE WERE DUNES ROCKS AND PLANTS THAT INSISTED ON LIVING WHERE SURVIVAL SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
sample-000343.wav,IT WAS AS IF THE WORLD HAD FALLEN SILENT BECAUSE THE BOY'S SOUL HAD
sample-000344.wav,THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
sample-000345.wav,THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COMPANY
sample-000346.wav,SHE WASN'T HER TYPE
sample-000347.wav,THE BOY LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OVENS AND OTHER APPARATUS USED IN ALCHEMY BUT SAW NONE
sample-000348.wav,BUT WHY DO YOU WANT A DIVORCE
sample-000349.wav,THERE WAS NO NEED TO IMPRISON THEM THE ARABS SIMPLY CONFISCATED THEIR HORSES
sample-000350.wav,CAN YOU HEAR ME
sample-000351.wav,YES THAT'S WHAT LOVE IS
sample-000352.wav,THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
sample-000353.wav,WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIM
sample-000354.wav,THEY PLACED THE SYMBOLS OF THE PILGRIMAGE ON THE DOORS OF THEIR HOUSES
sample-000355.wav,NOW I TOO WILL BE ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO WAIT
sample-000356.wav,BEFORE THE SUN HAD REACHED ITS HIGH POINT FIVE HUNDRED TRIBESMEN APPEARED ON THE HORIZON
sample-000357.wav,OTHERS STUMBLED UPON THE STONE BY ACCIDENT
sample-000358.wav,WHAT'S ALL THIS MESS
sample-000359.wav,BUT NOW I'M SAD AND ALONE
sample-000360.wav,HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
sample-000361.wav,WHEN YOU ARE LOVED YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IN CREATION
sample-000362.wav,THE GUITAR BROKE AND SHE COULDN'T PLAY ANYMORE
sample-000363.wav,WHO DO YOU FEEL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT
sample-000364.wav,DO YOU HAVE ANY SECRET HIDING PLACE HERE IN THE HOUSE
sample-000365.wav,THEY WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK
sample-000366.wav,I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
sample-000367.wav,I'M CRAZY ABOUT ADRIAN
sample-000368.wav,HE WAS SURE THE GIRL WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND
sample-000369.wav,HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
sample-000370.wav,THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
sample-000371.wav,THE ALCHEMIST DISMOUNTED SLOWLY AND THE BOY DID THE SAME
sample-000372.wav,HE STARTED TO READ THE BOOK HE HAD BOUGHT
sample-000373.wav,THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
sample-000374.wav,ONE KEY IS FOR ENCRYPTION THE OTHER ONE FOR DECRYPTION
sample-000375.wav,HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DODGES AND TRICKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS
sample-000376.wav,MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
sample-000377.wav,I'M NEVER MORE AWARE OF A ROOM'S ACOUSTICS THAN WHEN I'M TRYING TO ENJOY A SNACK I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SHARING
sample-000378.wav,BETTER GET A PENCIL OUT AND WRITE IT DOWN
sample-000379.wav,VISITING A UNIVERSITY OFFERS GREAT CHANCES FOR YOUR CAREER
sample-000380.wav,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
sample-000381.wav,THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
sample-000382.wav,HIS SEAT WAS UNSTABLE
sample-000383.wav,THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sample-000384.wav,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
sample-000385.wav,I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
sample-000386.wav,I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES
sample-000387.wav,HOW DOES SLACKER ROBBIE FEEL ABOUT THAT
sample-000388.wav,THE WAR IS GOING TO END SOMEDAY THE GIRL SAID
sample-000389.wav,I HAD A MOMENTARY IMPULSE TO GO BACK AND HELP HIM BUT I WAS TOO SCARED TO DO ANYTHING
sample-000390.wav,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sample-000391.wav,IS WINGED VICTORY SHOWING ANYWHERE IN ONE MINUTE
sample-000392.wav,AND ASK FOR A GLASS OF WINE FOR ME
sample-000393.wav,I DON'T THINK I FOLLOW YOU
sample-000394.wav,AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED
sample-000395.wav,CAN I HELP YOU ASKED THE MAN BEHIND THE WINDOW
sample-000396.wav,SOMETHING TERRIBLY IMPORTANT'S HAPPENED
sample-000397.wav,EVERYONE WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG KNOWS WHAT THEIR DESTINY IS
sample-000398.wav,WHERE WAS HIS HORSE
sample-000399.wav,YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN GET IT
sample-000400.wav,YOU'RE SURE YOU DON'T MIND
sample-000401.wav,IT IS THE MOST VALUABLE STAMP IN THE WORLD
sample-000402.wav,AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
sample-000403.wav,EVERYONE ON EARTH HAS A TREASURE THAT AWAITS HIM HIS HEART SAID
sample-000404.wav,HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
sample-000405.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sample-000406.wav,IT WAS THE PURE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
sample-000407.wav,HE KNEW HOW TO SHEAR THEM AND HOW TO SLAUGHTER THEM
sample-000408.wav,HE DECIDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE
sample-000409.wav,THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sample-000410.wav,THE BOY WAS GETTING IRRITATED
sample-000411.wav,WHENEVER HE SAW THE SEA OR A FIRE HE FELL SILENT IMPRESSED BY THEIR ELEMENTAL FORCE
sample-000412.wav,THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
sample-000413.wav,THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
sample-000414.wav,I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sample-000415.wav,AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sample-000416.wav,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
sample-000417.wav,NOW I'M BEGINNING WHAT I COULD HAVE STARTED TEN YEARS AGO
sample-000418.wav,WHEN THE SIMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN
sample-000419.wav,THE HEAT LASTED UNTIL NIGHTFALL AND ALL THAT TIME HE HAD TO CARRY HIS JACKET
sample-000420.wav,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sample-000421.wav,IT SEEMED AS IF WHAT THE OLD KING HAD CALLED BEGINNER'S LUCK WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING
sample-000422.wav,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
sample-000423.wav,AND TO DO THAT YOU NEED MONEY
sample-000424.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE HIS FAN MAIL
sample-000425.wav,A DROUGHT HIT WESTERN EUROPE
sample-000426.wav,I GET MORE OF A KICK OUT OF IT THAT WAY
sample-000427.wav,THAT'S ALL YOU ARE
sample-000428.wav,DO YOU WANT TO GO TO WORK FOR ME THE MERCHANT ASKED
sample-000429.wav,EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE
sample-000430.wav,WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT
sample-000431.wav,NEARBY WAS THE ENGLISHMAN READING A BOOK
sample-000432.wav,I WON A FLOWER
sample-000433.wav,WHERE DO YOU LIVE
sample-000434.wav,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
sample-000435.wav,IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
sample-000436.wav,LOOKING AROUND HE SOUGHT HIS SHEEP AND THEN REALIZED THAT HE WAS IN A NEW WORLD
sample-000437.wav,I WANT TO SEE THE CHIEFTAINS
sample-000438.wav,I COULD HAVE HELPED HER
sample-000439.wav,AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sample-000440.wav,THE BOY WENT TO LOOK FOR THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-000441.wav,IT WAS THE OLD MAN WHO SPOKE FIRST
sample-000442.wav,I'M NOT GOING TO CHARGE YOU ANYTHING NOW SHE SAID
sample-000443.wav,PEOPLE SAY STRANGE THINGS THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-000444.wav,WHAT HAD BEEN NEXT TO HIM FIVE MINUTES AGO WAS NOW AT THE OTHER SIDE
sample-000445.wav,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sample-000446.wav,AND IN THAT WAY THE MONTHS PASSED
sample-000447.wav,TO NOURISH THE FALCON
sample-000448.wav,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sample-000449.wav,IT'S AWFULLY CLEAR NOW
sample-000450.wav,I HAVE WATCHED THE CARAVAN AS IT CROSSED THE DESERT HE SAID
sample-000451.wav,THIS IS KEITH MILLER
sample-000452.wav,THE WAR IS GOING TO END SOMEDAY THE GIRL SAID
sample-000453.wav,THE SHEEP HAD TAUGHT HIM THAT
sample-000454.wav,WHAT'S YOUR NAME HE ASKED
sample-000455.wav,THE PINK LOVE HEART KEYRING GLOWED
sample-000456.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sample-000457.wav,HE WAS TWENTY MINUTES FROM HIS TENT AND BEGAN TO MAKE HIS WAY THERE
sample-000458.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-000459.wav,IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sample-000460.wav,CAN I GET A WOOT WOOT
sample-000461.wav,THERE WAS A SMALL BUILDING THERE WITH A WINDOW AT WHICH PEOPLE BOUGHT TICKETS TO AFRICA
sample-000462.wav,ONE NIGHT THE FATHER HAD A DREAM
sample-000463.wav,THE BOY PICKED UP HIS POUCH AND PUT IT WITH HIS OTHER THINGS
sample-000464.wav,THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
sample-000465.wav,I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE
sample-000466.wav,DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
sample-000467.wav,THIS IS THE FIRST PHASE OF THE JOB HE SAID
sample-000468.wav,SINCE THEN I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANOTHER ONE
sample-000469.wav,THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING SITUATION
sample-000470.wav,YOU CERTAINLY DELIVERED THE GOODS
sample-000471.wav,THIS IS CHRISTMAS EVE
sample-000472.wav,IT WAS THE LEVANTER THE WIND THAT CAME FROM AFRICA
sample-000473.wav,HOW DID YOU FIND OUT
sample-000474.wav,THE ALCHEMIST LIGHTED THE FIRE AND SOON A DELICIOUS AROMA FILLED THE TENT
sample-000475.wav,THEY ATE IN SILENCE
sample-000476.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
sample-000477.wav,THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sample-000478.wav,THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
sample-000479.wav,AND IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT LOVE
sample-000480.wav,I'M GOING TO THEM
sample-000481.wav,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
sample-000482.wav,THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
sample-000483.wav,SO HE ASKED IF THE OLD MAN'S BLESSING WAS STILL WITH HIM
sample-000484.wav,WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK AND EAT THESE HAWKS
sample-000485.wav,NEVER STOP DREAMING THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sample-000486.wav,HE PAUSED AND HIS EYES WERE STILL UNFRIENDLY
sample-000487.wav,UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
sample-000488.wav,FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
sample-000489.wav,AND THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WELL
sample-000490.wav,DO YOU KNOW THAT I THREW IT AWAY
sample-000491.wav,ANOTHER TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-000492.wav,YOU'RE PLAYING WITH DYNAMITE
sample-000493.wav,THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD
sample-000494.wav,ARE YOU COMING TOMORROW
sample-000495.wav,SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVOLVED
sample-000496.wav,I WOULD HAVE WON THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS IF NOT FOR THOSE MEDALING KIDS
sample-000497.wav,I'VE GOT INDIGESTION
sample-000498.wav,HE IS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWERS
sample-000499.wav,IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE THE BOY SAID
sample-000500.wav,LISTEN DON'T BELIEVE WHAT HE SAYS
sample-000501.wav,THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sample-000502.wav,AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sample-000503.wav,THE BOY REMINDED THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HIDDEN TREASURE
sample-000504.wav,SHE USED HER MICROSCOPE TO INSPECT IT
sample-000505.wav,WILL YOU GET CLOSE TO HIM
sample-000506.wav,ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS
sample-000507.wav,IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WINE HE HAD EVER TASTED
sample-000508.wav,DID YOU GET THE MAYOR
sample-000509.wav,THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
sample-000510.wav,IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND
sample-000511.wav,IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE HAD BEEN HERE AND LEFT HIS MARK HE THOUGHT
sample-000512.wav,WHY DO YOU WANT TO FIND THAT SORT OF PERSON THE ARAB ASKED
sample-000513.wav,THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER
sample-000514.wav,HE'LL BE READY ON TIME
sample-000515.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
sample-000516.wav,I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT DREAMS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-000517.wav,EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
sample-000518.wav,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sample-000519.wav,DURING THE THIRD YEAR THE OMENS WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OF YOUR TREASURE AND YOUR DESTINY
sample-000520.wav,I SOLD CRYSTAL AND CROSSED THE DESERT
sample-000521.wav,LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
sample-000522.wav,SO YOU GOT MARRIED
sample-000523.wav,I STILL HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY REPEATED
sample-000524.wav,IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE
sample-000525.wav,MAYBE BECAUSE THAT WASN'T REALLY HIS DREAM
sample-000526.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sample-000527.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER WAS SEATED AT THE BASE OF A PALM TREE OBSERVING THE SUNSET
sample-000528.wav,HE INSTEAD OFFERS AN ALTERNATE EXPLANATION THAT RELATES TO SITE SCALABILITY ISSUES
sample-000529.wav,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sample-000530.wav,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sample-000531.wav,SHE PLACED THE GLASS CAREFULLY ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE
sample-000532.wav,BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO KEEP IT QUIET
sample-000533.wav,I CAN SEND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION TO IT FROM OTHER APPS
sample-000534.wav,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sample-000535.wav,WHY WAS IT THAT HE WANTED THE BOY TO SERVE AS HIS INSTRUMENT
sample-000536.wav,SHE WASN'T HER TYPE
sample-000537.wav,I'LL HAVE IT IN A MINUTE
sample-000538.wav,THEY WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GOLD HIS COMPANION ANSWERED
sample-000539.wav,YOU CAN HEAR OUT OF IT
sample-000540.wav,BUT SHE SAID NOTHING
sample-000541.wav,I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING
sample-000542.wav,AND THEN THERE WERE THE OTHERS WHO WERE INTERESTED ONLY IN GOLD
sample-000543.wav,MAY I GO IN AND SEE HIM
sample-000544.wav,IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO THE BOY TO FLEE
sample-000545.wav,WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
sample-000546.wav,MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY CAME
sample-000547.wav,I KNOW THAT GIRL
sample-000548.wav,I'D LIKE TO BUILD A DISPLAY CASE FOR THE CRYSTAL THE BOY SAID TO THE MERCHANT
sample-000549.wav,IT'S A PRIVATE CLUB FOR ONLY THE MOST RESPECTABLE PEOPLE
sample-000550.wav,WE MIGRATED OUR STUFF FROM MAC OS TO LINUX
sample-000551.wav,TOO MUCH FOOD IS BEING WASTED
sample-000552.wav,OTHER SERVANTS MAINTAINED THE FIRES IN THE HOOKAHS
sample-000553.wav,YOU GOT SOMEPLACE TO SLEEP
sample-000554.wav,THEIR FACES WERE HIDDEN BEHIND BLUE VEILS WITH ONLY THEIR EYES SHOWING
sample-000555.wav,BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sample-000556.wav,BUT NONE OF THAT IS FROM THE PYRAMIDS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-000557.wav,THAT INSANE ANDROID CONTINUES TO IGNORE ME
sample-000558.wav,BUT THEN HE STOPPED
sample-000559.wav,WHAT IS LOVE THE DESERT ASKED
sample-000560.wav,BETTER BRING ME A GLASS OF MILK
sample-000561.wav,ARE YOU SURE THIS IS CLAIRE
sample-000562.wav,THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
sample-000563.wav,SOME STORMS ARE WORTH THE WRECKAGE
sample-000564.wav,SHE SPOKE SWEDISH HE SPOKE SPANISH
sample-000565.wav,I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
sample-000566.wav,DO NOT DO TOMORROW WHAT YOU COULD DO TODAY
sample-000567.wav,SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED
sample-000568.wav,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
sample-000569.wav,THE BOY SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
sample-000570.wav,THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
sample-000571.wav,IT'S LIKE THE FLIGHT OF THOSE TWO HAWKS IT CAN'T BE UNDERSTOOD BY REASON ALONE
sample-000572.wav,AND SO DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS A ROMAN CENTURION HE CONVERTED TO THEIR FAITH
sample-000573.wav,IS THIS THE EAR YOU CAN'T HEAR ON
sample-000574.wav,DURING ONE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THE DRIVER TOLD OF HIS OWN LIFE
sample-000575.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sample-000576.wav,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
sample-000577.wav,YOU'LL LIVE AND YOU'LL LEARN THAT A MAN SHOULDN'T BE SO STUPID
sample-000578.wav,IT WAS A MEGA MONSTER MADE OF METAL
sample-000579.wav,WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO REPORT
sample-000580.wav,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sample-000581.wav,GO AND SPEAK TO THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sample-000582.wav,A LOT OF PATIENCE BUT SHEPHERDS KNOW ALL ABOUT PATIENCE
sample-000583.wav,IT WAS BETTER THAN THE SCENT OF THE HOOKAHS
sample-000584.wav,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sample-000585.wav,EVEN IF YOU CLEANED MY CRYSTAL FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR
sample-000586.wav,BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sample-000587.wav,HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
sample-000588.wav,AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
sample-000589.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
sample-000590.wav,WELL THEN WHY DID YOU LET ME DO IT THE BOY ASKED
sample-000591.wav,MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
sample-000592.wav,HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
sample-000593.wav,HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sample-000594.wav,FIRST THEY TRIED TO FIND HIM ON THEIR OWN
sample-000595.wav,I LOCKED EYES WITH A FISH IN THE TANK
sample-000596.wav,HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT
sample-000597.wav,JACKSON WAS GLAD THAT HE'D WORE KEVLAR THAT MORNING
sample-000598.wav,THE ALCHEMIST ERASED THE CIRCLE IN THE SAND AND THE SNAKE SLITHERED AWAY AMONG THE ROCKS
sample-000599.wav,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
sample-000600.wav,THE BOY WAS STARTLED
sample-000601.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER THOUGH SEEMED NOT TO BE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE THREAT OF WAR
sample-000602.wav,MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY GIVE UP ON IT SO EARLY TOO
sample-000603.wav,THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS OGILVY AND HENDERSON HAD LEFT IT
sample-000604.wav,HE TOOK OUT HIS MONEY AND COUNTED IT
sample-000605.wav,THIS IS UNFAIR
sample-000606.wav,THE RELIEF ON HER FACE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD
sample-000607.wav,I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
sample-000608.wav,HE HAD TRIED IN VAIN TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ALCHEMIST
sample-000609.wav,BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE THE CASTLES IN THE TOWNS WHERE THEY LIVE THE BOY EXPLAINED
sample-000610.wav,I KNOWS I'M A LUXURY
sample-000611.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sample-000612.wav,MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
sample-000613.wav,ONCE TO THE THIEF AND ONCE TO THE GENERAL
sample-000614.wav,I WANT TO SEE HIM DO IT SAID THE CHIEF
sample-000615.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-000616.wav,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sample-000617.wav,BUT THE BOY WAS TOO FRIGHTENED TO LISTEN TO WORDS OF WISDOM
sample-000618.wav,AMY'S A GENIUS AT RESEARCH
sample-000619.wav,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
sample-000620.wav,BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE
sample-000621.wav,THEY ALWAYS DO THAT
sample-000622.wav,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sample-000623.wav,THEY PLACED THE SYMBOLS OF THE PILGRIMAGE ON THE DOORS OF THEIR HOUSES
sample-000624.wav,THE DRIVERS CARRIED THE FREIGHT THEMSELVES OVER SUCH TREACHEROUS FOOTING AND THEN RELOADED THE CAMELS
sample-000625.wav,NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN
sample-000626.wav,MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE THEY MOVED AROUND SO MUCH
sample-000627.wav,AFTER TWO HOURS HE RETURNED TO THE ROOM WHERE THE WISE MAN WAS
sample-000628.wav,I THINK IT'S ABOUT BIRD HUNTING BUT NOW I CAN SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED
sample-000629.wav,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sample-000630.wav,WHEN TALKING TO SOMEONE WHO HAS JUST STARTED TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE ITS GOOD TO SPEAK SLOWLY AND CLEARLY
sample-000631.wav,HE BECAME FRIENDLY WITH THE CAMEL DRIVER WHO TRAVELED ALONGSIDE HIM
sample-000632.wav,THE WIND BEGAN TO PICK UP
sample-000633.wav,THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
sample-000634.wav,THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FALLING STAR
sample-000635.wav,BEFORE THE BOY COULD REPLY A BUTTERFLY APPEARED AND FLUTTERED BETWEEN HIM AND THE OLD MAN
sample-000636.wav,IS THAT SCREWBALL PITPAT STILL AROUND
sample-000637.wav,LOVE REQUIRED THEM TO STAY WITH THE PEOPLE THEY LOVED
sample-000638.wav,HE'S IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS
sample-000639.wav,IT WAS REPETITIOUS BUT SOOTHING
sample-000640.wav,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
sample-000641.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sample-000642.wav,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sample-000643.wav,SO NOW I FEAR NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS THOSE OMENS THAT BROUGHT YOU TO ME
sample-000644.wav,I'M THE LEADER OF THE CARAVAN SAID A DARKEYED BEARDED MAN
sample-000645.wav,AND HE DECIDED HE WOULD GO TO SEE THE CHIEFS OF THE TRIBES
sample-000646.wav,HE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE SHEEP WERE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAID
sample-000647.wav,TWO MORE MONTHS PASSED AND THE SHELF BROUGHT MANY CUSTOMERS INTO THE CRYSTAL SHOP
sample-000648.wav,I DON'T WANT ANY PLASTICS
sample-000649.wav,THIS PUTS ME IN A PECULIAR HOLE
sample-000650.wav,I'M GOING TO TELL YOUR MOTHER ON YOU
sample-000651.wav,IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sample-000652.wav,I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE
sample-000653.wav,HE SHOULD HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A SHEPHERD THE BOY SAID
sample-000654.wav,THE BOY BEGAN AGAIN TO READ HIS BOOK BUT HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO CONCENTRATE
sample-000655.wav,AFTER ALL WHAT HE HAD ALWAYS WANTED WAS JUST THAT TO KNOW NEW PLACES
sample-000656.wav,TAKE YOUR PAWS OFF ME
sample-000657.wav,HE FELT UNEASY AT THE MAN'S PRESENCE
sample-000658.wav,YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING
sample-000659.wav,BUT HE APPEARED TO BE UNAWARE OF ANY DANGER
sample-000660.wav,THEY BEGAN TO RIDE OUT OVER THE SANDS WITH THE MOON LIGHTING THEIR WAY
sample-000661.wav,NEXT MORNING THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND ARMED MEN SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE PALM TREES AT AL FAYOUM
sample-000662.wav,DON'T YOU KNOW THAT GIRL'S VERY SICK
sample-000663.wav,AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE
sample-000664.wav,SPAIN IS PRODUCING LOTS OF LETTUCE PAPRIKA AND TOMATOES
sample-000665.wav,HIS HANDS BEGAN TO TREMBLE AND THE WOMAN SENSED IT
sample-000666.wav,YOU PUT SOMETHING WRONG IN THOSE CAPSULES
sample-000667.wav,HE REACHED OVER AND PICKED UP A SHELL FROM THE GROUND
sample-000668.wav,HE KNEW HE WAS STRONGER THAN HIS FRIEND
sample-000669.wav,IT MAY BE THE GASES OF THE FIRING THAT CAUSED THE MARTIANS INCONVENIENCE
sample-000670.wav,IT'S THE ONLY ONE THEY HAD LEFT
sample-000671.wav,THEY REACHED THE CENTER OF A LARGE PLAZA WHERE THE MARKET WAS HELD
sample-000672.wav,HOW DO PEOPLE CELEBRATE GOOD WEATHER OVER THERE
sample-000673.wav,THERE WAS A THUD LIKE THE FALL OF A GREAT MASS
sample-000674.wav,AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sample-000675.wav,DON'T SAY ANYTHING FATIMA INTERRUPTED
sample-000676.wav,THE ANIMALS WERE EXHAUSTED AND THE MEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES LESS AND LESS
sample-000677.wav,THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
sample-000678.wav,EXCEPT FOR MY ULCERS
sample-000679.wav,HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT AND THE NIGHT AFTER
sample-000680.wav,WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE THINGS MAKE EVEN MORE SENSE HE THOUGHT
sample-000681.wav,TAKING THE JACKET OUT HE BEGAN TO CLEAN THE GLASSES
sample-000682.wav,AND THEN HE WOULD ASK US TO GO BACK TO OUR EASELS AND REPLICATE ALL THE TECHNIQUES IN ONE GO
sample-000683.wav,BUT THE ENGLISHMAN APPEARED NOT TO ATTACH ANY IMPORTANCE TO IT
sample-000684.wav,I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sample-000685.wav,THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PRINTING PRESS IN THOSE DAYS THE BOY ARGUED
sample-000686.wav,HE WON'T LEAVE THE CIRCLE
sample-000687.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-000688.wav,BUT EVERYONE AND HIS AUNT LILIAN'S BEEN THROUGH THAT BAG
sample-000689.wav,I GOT IT ALL READY
sample-000690.wav,ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sample-000691.wav,THE BOY TURNED TO THE HAND THAT WROTE ALL
sample-000692.wav,I LOOKED AT THE CYLINDER AGAIN AND WAS COMPLETELY TERRIFIED
sample-000693.wav,COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
sample-000694.wav,THOSE GYPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE THOUGHT
sample-000695.wav,IT ISN'T THE MONEY
sample-000696.wav,IF HE ABANDONS THAT PURSUIT IT'S BECAUSE IT WASN'T TRUELOVE
sample-000697.wav,MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sample-000698.wav,HE COULD SELL THE STONES AND BUY A RETURN TICKET
sample-000699.wav,NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
sample-000700.wav,NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
sample-000701.wav,THAT'S TRUE THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-000702.wav,HE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AND WAS SURE THAT SHE HAD PROBABLY MARRIED
sample-000703.wav,THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sample-000704.wav,NOW LEAVE US ALONE SAID THE BOY TO THE YOUNG ARAB
sample-000705.wav,TODAY I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING I DIDN'T SEE BEFORE EVERY BLESSING IGNORED BECOMES A CURSE
sample-000706.wav,BUT ONLY SPEAK A WORD AND MY SERVANT WILL BE HEALED
sample-000707.wav,THEN WHOSE IS IT
sample-000708.wav,TWO HORSEMEN WAITING AHEAD OF THEM
sample-000709.wav,BUT YOU KNOW THAT I'M NOT GOING TO GO TO MECCA
sample-000710.wav,WHO WROTE THAT SPEECH FOR YOU
sample-000711.wav,THE ARTICLE SHOULD DISCUSS POSSIBLE APPROACHES TO IMAGE REGISTRATION
sample-000712.wav,MAYBE WE'RE ALL THAT WAY THE BOY MUSED
sample-000713.wav,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
sample-000714.wav,NOW I TOO WILL BE ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO WAIT
sample-000715.wav,IT'S EASY AND YET I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE HE THOUGHT
sample-000716.wav,I THINK MAYBE YOU'D BETTER
sample-000717.wav,SEE IF WE CAN MOVE IT
sample-000718.wav,NOW HIS INTUITION WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN RIGHT IN COMING
sample-000719.wav,HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
sample-000720.wav,IT'S JUST THAT I NEVER HAVE
sample-000721.wav,COMING HOME A PARTY OF TOURISTS PASSED US SINGING AND PLAYING MUSIC
sample-000722.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-000723.wav,YOU OLD SORCERER THE BOY SHOUTED UP TO THE SKY
sample-000724.wav,ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
sample-000725.wav,THE BOY FELL TO THE SAND NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS
sample-000726.wav,ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-000727.wav,ALMOST EVERYONE HERE SPEAKS SPANISH
sample-000728.wav,THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
sample-000729.wav,IT WAS A A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
sample-000730.wav,THEY'RE ALWAYS AFTER ME FOR INTERVIEWS
sample-000731.wav,WHAT GOOD IS MONEY TO YOU IF YOU'RE GOING TO DIE
sample-000732.wav,ADVANCING SLOWLY THEY SEARCHED AMONG THE STONES
sample-000733.wav,AN ALCHEMIST SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-000734.wav,WAS THE DOCTOR HERE
sample-000735.wav,PUT JACKIE RIGHT ON THE STAFF
sample-000736.wav,SHE WANTS TO SEND YOU ON A LECTURE TOUR
sample-000737.wav,BUT AS HE SAW THEM LYING THERE ON THE GROUND ANOTHER PHRASE CAME TO HIS MIND
sample-000738.wav,BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST YOUR SAVINGS TWICE
sample-000739.wav,THE DEAD SOLDIERS WERE REPLACED BY OTHERS AND LIFE WENT ON
sample-000740.wav,I DIDN'T KNOW SHEPHERDS KNEW HOW TO READ SAID A GIRL'S VOICE BEHIND HIM
sample-000741.wav,I LEARNED HOW TO CARE FOR SHEEP AND I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN HOW THAT'S DONE
sample-000742.wav,I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
sample-000743.wav,TO NOURISH THE FALCON
sample-000744.wav,THE LITTLE GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM THE CITY DISPERSED
sample-000745.wav,WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
sample-000746.wav,THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
sample-000747.wav,LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sample-000748.wav,I WOULD HAVE WON THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS IF NOT FOR THOSE MEDALING KIDS
sample-000749.wav,BUT HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T DESIRE THAT AN ARMY INVADE THE OASIS
sample-000750.wav,THAT FIRST DAY EVERYONE SLEPT FROM EXHAUSTION INCLUDING THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-000751.wav,MAYBE NO ONE HERE KNOWS WHAT AN ALCHEMIST IS
sample-000752.wav,THEY WORKED FROM EARLY MORNING TILL LATE EVENING
sample-000753.wav,BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
sample-000754.wav,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
sample-000755.wav,THE ALCHEMIST TURNED TO THE BOY
sample-000756.wav,THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
sample-000757.wav,THE ALCHEMIST PROBABLY ALREADY KNEW ALL THAT
sample-000758.wav,THAT'S AN INHERENT DISADVANTAGE
sample-000759.wav,I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT I SAW
sample-000760.wav,HE REALLY WAS A KING A WISE KING
sample-000761.wav,YOU WERE SEEN AT THE ENEMY CAMP THREE DAYS AGO
sample-000762.wav,IN ALCHEMY IT'S CALLED THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
sample-000763.wav,I READ ONLY WHAT THE BIRDS WANTED TO TELL ME
sample-000764.wav,A PRACTICE OF INFIDELS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
sample-000765.wav,HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
sample-000766.wav,THE BOY TOOK OUT URIM AND THUMMIM FROM HIS BAG
sample-000767.wav,THE FINE MANUFACTURING COMPANY WAS A BOOKKEEPER FOR FOURTEEN YEARS
sample-000768.wav,THAT'S A LOT OF HOOEY
sample-000769.wav,THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
sample-000770.wav,REPLACE THE TS IN TIM TEBOW'S NAME WITH ANY OTHER CONSONANT TO GET A STAR WARS CHARACTER
sample-000771.wav,BUT THIS PAYMENT GOES WELL BEYOND MY GENEROSITY THE MONK RESPONDED
sample-000772.wav,YOU CAN'T DO THAT
sample-000773.wav,WE NEED TO BE CONFIDENT ALL OF US HE PROPOSED A SOLUTION
sample-000774.wav,MAKE YOU'RE A HERO SURE AS YOU'RE BORN
sample-000775.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sample-000776.wav,FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
sample-000777.wav,THE AREA WAS SWIRLING IN DUST SO INTENSE THAT IT HID THE MOON FROM VIEW
sample-000778.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
sample-000779.wav,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sample-000780.wav,HE CARRIED TWO DEAD HAWKS OVER HIS SHOULDER
sample-000781.wav,AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sample-000782.wav,THE MAN WAS SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE OF ALCHEMY
sample-000783.wav,THEN WHY SHOULD THEY BE SURPRISED WHEN THEY SEE ONE
sample-000784.wav,THE RANGER TOOK HIS RIFLE AND WENT INTO THE FOREST TO SHOOT THE BEAR
sample-000785.wav,WHY WAS IT THAT HE WANTED THE BOY TO SERVE AS HIS INSTRUMENT
sample-000786.wav,THE ALCHEMIST OPENED A BOTTLE AND POURED A RED LIQUID INTO THE BOY'S CUP
sample-000787.wav,NEITHER THE RADAR NOR THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS DETECTED THE STEALTH BOMBER
sample-000788.wav,IT REMINDED HIM OF THE WOOL FROM HIS SHEEP
sample-000789.wav,YOU'RE NOT ASKING A FAVOR OF HIM
sample-000790.wav,I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
sample-000791.wav,MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
sample-000792.wav,SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
sample-000793.wav,AT THAT POINT IN THEIR LIVES EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE
sample-000794.wav,HE ROSE AND MADE HIS WAY BACK TOWARD THE PALM TREES
sample-000795.wav,I HAVE NEVER SEEN A ROTHSCHILD BEFORE
sample-000796.wav,THAT MAKES SENSE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-000797.wav,THE BOY LOOKED OUT AT THE HORIZON
sample-000798.wav,I DIDN'T FRISK HIM
sample-000799.wav,IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
sample-000800.wav,SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
sample-000801.wav,THAT WAS HIS WORK
sample-000802.wav,SHE'S GOING TO LOSE HER MIND WHEN SHE FINDS OUT
sample-000803.wav,SOMETHING OLDER THAN HUMANITY MORE ANCIENT THAN THE DESERT
sample-000804.wav,KEEP ME HERE UNTIL I GET OVER IT
sample-000805.wav,THE BOYS'LL BE COMING BACK TO PHONE
sample-000806.wav,THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT CONTAINS POLITICIANS
sample-000807.wav,IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
sample-000808.wav,THAT NIGHT HE TOLD ALL OF THIS TO THE ALCHEMIST
sample-000809.wav,I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING AND LOAN
sample-000810.wav,GYPSIES ARE EXPERTS AT GETTING PEOPLE TO DO THAT SIGHED THE OLD MAN
sample-000811.wav,THE MERCHANTS WERE ASSEMBLING THEIR STALLS AND THE BOY HELPED A CANDY SELLER TO DO HIS
sample-000812.wav,MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
sample-000813.wav,THE NEXT DAY THE BOY RETURNED TO THE WELL HOPING TO SEE THE GIRL
sample-000814.wav,AND HE DECIDED HE WOULD GO TO SEE THE CHIEFS OF THE TRIBES
sample-000815.wav,BUSINESS HAS REALLY IMPROVED HE SAID TO THE BOY AFTER THE CUSTOMER HAD LEFT
sample-000816.wav,THE SHOP WAS BUSY AND THE MAN ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO WAIT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON
sample-000817.wav,BUT HE KEPT THE SWORD IN HIS HAND
sample-000818.wav,THE WIND TOLD ME THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE THE BOY SAID TO THE SUN
sample-000819.wav,I HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT THE SULFUR
sample-000820.wav,COME ON IN HERE NOW
sample-000821.wav,BUT ONLY SPEAK A WORD AND MY SERVANT WILL BE HEALED
sample-000822.wav,IN HIS HEART HE WANTED TO REMAIN AWAKE BUT HE ALSO WANTED TO SLEEP
sample-000823.wav,HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE
sample-000824.wav,BUT EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED
sample-000825.wav,THE HAND WITH THE WHIP POINTED TO THE SOUTH
sample-000826.wav,I GOT WAYS OF MAKING THEM TALK
sample-000827.wav,WHEN HE HAD COMPLETED THE CLEANING HE ASKED THE MAN FOR SOMETHING TO EAT
sample-000828.wav,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sample-000829.wav,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
sample-000830.wav,I WOULDN'T LIVE IN IT AS A GHOST
sample-000831.wav,THE ANIMALS WERE EXHAUSTED AND THE MEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES LESS AND LESS
sample-000832.wav,OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
sample-000833.wav,AND ALSO BECAUSE I KNOW ABOUT THE SOUL OF THE WORLD HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
sample-000834.wav,THE OMENS HAD TOLD HIM SO
sample-000835.wav,THE PINK LOVE HEART KEYRING GLOWED
sample-000836.wav,WHAT IS A FOREIGNER DOING HERE ASKED ANOTHER OF THE MEN
sample-000837.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-000838.wav,I FORGOT MY HAT
sample-000839.wav,YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
sample-000840.wav,I LIKE CYNDI WAYNE
sample-000841.wav,IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
sample-000842.wav,WORK HAS BEEN ROUGH IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE OF A MAJOR PROJECT LAUNCH
sample-000843.wav,THE BOY WATCHED THE EXCHANGE WITH FASCINATION
sample-000844.wav,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sample-000845.wav,HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
sample-000846.wav,THOSE ARE THE RULES OF WAR THE LEADER EXPLAINED
sample-000847.wav,BUT HIS HEART WAS SPEAKING OF OTHER THINGS
sample-000848.wav,THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sample-000849.wav,THEY LOCKED THEMSELVES IN THEIR LABORATORIES AND TRIED TO EVOLVE AS GOLD HAD
sample-000850.wav,HE HAD NEVER IMAGINED THAT QUESTIONS ABOUT LIFE WOULD BE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE TO A SHEPHERD
sample-000851.wav,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sample-000852.wav,THEN YOU TAUGHT ME SOMETHING OF THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AND THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
sample-000853.wav,AND YOUR CAMELS WILL BRING YOU WEALTH AND POWER
sample-000854.wav,THE BOY LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OVENS AND OTHER APPARATUS USED IN ALCHEMY BUT SAW NONE
sample-000855.wav,AND SEIZING THE BOY'S BAG THE ALCHEMIST GAVE THE GOLD COINS TO THE CHIEF
sample-000856.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
sample-000857.wav,VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TENT
sample-000858.wav,I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-000859.wav,THERE WAS A FULL MOON AND THE BOY TOLD THE ENGLISHMAN THE STORY OF HIS LIFE
sample-000860.wav,THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
sample-000861.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER WAS NOT A FIGHTER AND HE HAD CONSULTED WITH SEERS
sample-000862.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
sample-000863.wav,REPLACE THE TS IN TIM TEBOW'S NAME WITH ANY OTHER CONSONANT TO GET A STAR WARS CHARACTER
sample-000864.wav,I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sample-000865.wav,BUT I WAS ALSO STUMBLING BECAUSE I COULDNT LOOK AWAY FROM THESE THINGS
sample-000866.wav,THERE'S MILLIONS OF WAYS
sample-000867.wav,WHAT DO I DO IN SALEM THE OLD MAN LAUGHED
sample-000868.wav,HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
sample-000869.wav,THERE ARE RUMORS OF TRIBAL WARS HE TOLD THEM
sample-000870.wav,EVEN IF YOU'RE AN EXPERT READING ALL OF IT IS OFTEN NOT FEASIBLE DUE TO LACK OF TIME
sample-000871.wav,ROBIN HAD SOME SORT OF DATE WITH TRACY
sample-000872.wav,THE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A PERSON AND HURRIED AWAY
sample-000873.wav,MODERN SEWING MACHINES CAN THROTTLE THEIR SPEED
sample-000874.wav,MARY TOLD ME THAT SHE GOT TO MEET UP WITH YOU WHILE SHE WAS BACK IN SAN FRANCISCO
sample-000875.wav,YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT MY FATHER
sample-000876.wav,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sample-000877.wav,THE USAGE OF HIGH INFORMATION CONTENT IS MEANINGLESS
sample-000878.wav,THE BOY CONTINUED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART AS THEY CROSSED THE DESERT
sample-000879.wav,BUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT HAD NO CHOICE
sample-000880.wav,INSTEAD THE STRANGER LOWERED IT SLOWLY UNTIL THE POINT TOUCHED THE BOY'S FOREHEAD
sample-000881.wav,YOU DON'T KNOW SCOTT
sample-000882.wav,BUT MAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
sample-000883.wav,ALWAYS HEED THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sample-000884.wav,AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHEMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS
sample-000885.wav,SO WHAT IS SALEM LIKE HE ASKED TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF CLUE
sample-000886.wav,LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOURLEAF CLOVERS
sample-000887.wav,HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
sample-000888.wav,THAT'S NOT MY MONEY
sample-000889.wav,IS HE REALLY SUPPOSED TO READ THAT MANY BOOKS ON PHILOSOPHY
sample-000890.wav,I GET THIRTY DOLLARS A WEEK
sample-000891.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN VANISHED TOO GONE TO FIND THE ALCHEMIST
sample-000892.wav,AND IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT LOVE
sample-000893.wav,OH ITS NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL RIGHT AWAY
sample-000894.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-000895.wav,THE BOY CLOSED HIS BOOK
sample-000896.wav,HOWEVER THE ARTICLE IS WRITTEN POORLY AND INCOMPREHENSIBLY
sample-000897.wav,THE MICROPHONE PUT OUT A MUFFLED SIGNAL
sample-000898.wav,IT WAS THE LEVANTER THE WIND THAT CAME FROM AFRICA
sample-000899.wav,I'M AFRAID YOU'RE BLOCKING MY VIEW
sample-000900.wav,AS THEY MOVED ALONG THE BOY TRIED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART
sample-000901.wav,MAYBE WE'RE ALL THAT WAY THE BOY MUSED
sample-000902.wav,THEY WALKED IN FROM THE RAIN ALL DISHEVELLED AND STEAMING
sample-000903.wav,HE COULD ALWAYS BECOME A CRYSTAL SALESMAN AGAIN
sample-000904.wav,THE OLD MAN WORE A BREASTPLATE OF HEAVY GOLD COVERED WITH PRECIOUS STONES
sample-000905.wav,I SOLD CRYSTAL AND CROSSED THE DESERT
sample-000906.wav,THE LADDER OF THE FIRE TRUCK WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH
sample-000907.wav,IS SHE COMING BACK HERE
sample-000908.wav,THEY CALLED IT THE SIMUM AND IT WAS WORSE THAN A STORM AT SEA
sample-000909.wav,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
sample-000910.wav,WHEN YOU ARE LOVED YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IN CREATION
sample-000911.wav,I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
sample-000912.wav,WE'RE ALL EXCITED AROUND HERE
sample-000913.wav,THERE'S ONE THAT SAYS 'EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ONCE CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
sample-000914.wav,IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
sample-000915.wav,THE ALCHEMIST IS TWO HUNDRED YEARS OLD THE ENGLISHMAN HAD TOLD HIM
sample-000916.wav,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
sample-000917.wav,THEN THE TWO WENT OFF TO HAVE SOME MORE TEA
sample-000918.wav,I'LL KEEP YOU IN MIND
sample-000919.wav,ON THE THIRD DAY THE CHIEF MET WITH HIS OFFICERS
sample-000920.wav,SO WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME THE SUN ASKED
sample-000921.wav,ITS EASIER TO ENDURE THE COLD IF YOU HAVE A WARM DRINK IN THE BELLY
sample-000922.wav,DON'T HURT MY SORE ARM AGAIN
sample-000923.wav,IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
sample-000924.wav,THERE WERE MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
sample-000925.wav,THOMAS WENT TO WAR
sample-000926.wav,IT'S A PRIVATE CLUB FOR ONLY THE MOST RESPECTABLE PEOPLE
sample-000927.wav,THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sample-000928.wav,IF WE SERVE TEA IN CRYSTAL THE SHOP IS GOING TO EXPAND
sample-000929.wav,ALWAYS ASK AN OBJECTIVE QUESTION
sample-000930.wav,WHY DO THEY NEED GIN
sample-000931.wav,ALL I SAW WAS AN ARMY SAID THE BOY
sample-000932.wav,WHAT DO YOU WANT HERE TODAY THE DESERT ASKED HIM
sample-000933.wav,MELISSA'S PHONE KEPT VIBRATING UNCONTROLLABLY
sample-000934.wav,AS THEY BROWSED THE STORE TOGETHER
sample-000935.wav,THE WAR CONTINUED AND AT TIMES THE WIND CARRIED THE SWEET SICKLY SMELL OF BLOOD
sample-000936.wav,LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
sample-000937.wav,DURING ONE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THE DRIVER TOLD OF HIS OWN LIFE
sample-000938.wav,GIMME THE RECEIVING ROOM
sample-000939.wav,PREFETCHING IS USED TO AVOID CACHE MISSES
sample-000940.wav,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
sample-000941.wav,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
sample-000942.wav,RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS
sample-000943.wav,HE'S OUT DUCKSHOOTING NOW
sample-000944.wav,THEN SHE FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER AND LEFT
sample-000945.wav,NATURALLY WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
sample-000946.wav,THERE WERE RAISED VOICESAND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON 
sample-000947.wav,BUT NOWHERE COULD HE FIND HIS NEW COMPANION
sample-000948.wav,AND HE DECIDED HE WOULD GO TO SEE THE CHIEFS OF THE TRIBES
sample-000949.wav,LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
sample-000950.wav,HER APARTMENT IS ON THE RD FLOOR
sample-000951.wav,WHO ARE YOU HE HEARD A VOICE ASK HIM IN SPANISH
sample-000952.wav,BRENDA PETERS JUST ESCAPED FROM THE COUNTY JAIL
sample-000953.wav,SHE JUST STEPPED OUT
sample-000954.wav,THE TRADITION TEACHES MEN HOW TO CROSS THE DESERT AND HOW THEIR CHILDREN SHOULD MARRY
sample-000955.wav,HE DRESSED IN HIS ARABIAN CLOTHING OF WHITE LINEN BOUGHT ESPECIALLY FOR THIS DAY
sample-000956.wav,THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP
sample-000957.wav,IT'S LIKE THE FLIGHT OF THOSE TWO HAWKS IT CAN'T BE UNDERSTOOD BY REASON ALONE
sample-000958.wav,MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN RIGHT ABOUT WHAT THEY SAID WHILE SOME HAD BEEN WRONG
sample-000959.wav,HAVE A GOOD TRIP
sample-000960.wav,SUDDENLY THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TIME IN A DAY BECAUSE SHE NO LONGER HAS TO SPEND HOURS COMMUTING

sample-000982.wav,THESE FIGURES OF WAX LOOK CREEPY
sample-000983.wav,NOT EVERYONE CAN SEE HIS DREAMS COME TRUE IN THE SAME WAY
sample-000984.wav,HE WAS ABLE TO GET ON HIS KNEES BUT HE QUICKLY SLIPPED BACK
sample-000985.wav,THE METHOD DOES NOT HAVE TO BE THE BEST
sample-000986.wav,I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T RUN INTO HER
sample-000987.wav,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
sample-000988.wav,I KNOW WHY I WANT TO GET BACK TO MY FLOCK HE THOUGHT
sample-000989.wav,THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sample-000990.wav,THE SPACE WAS SPARTAN ALMOST BARE

sample-000999.wav,IT MEANS ONLY THAT THE HEART DOES WHAT IT CAN THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sample-001000.wav,THE SUN BEGAN ITS DEPARTURE AS WELL
sample-001001.wav,WHEN THE PAN HAD COOLED THE MONK AND THE BOY LOOKED AT IT DAZZLED
sample-001002.wav,ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
sample-001003.wav,THE BOSS SENT ME OVER WITH IT
sample-001004.wav,THAT'S ALL YOU ARE
sample-001005.wav,IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
sample-001006.wav,IS IT A DEAL
sample-001007.wav,BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sample-001008.wav,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-001009.wav,DON'T MIND THE COLONEL
sample-001010.wav,YOU'VE BEEN DOING MIGHTY GOOD WORK LATELY

sample-001018.wav,THE MAN WAS SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE OF ALCHEMY
sample-001019.wav,JUST GET ME HOME
sample-001020.wav,BUT I WAS ALSO STUMBLING BECAUSE I COULDNT LOOK AWAY FROM THESE THINGS
sample-001021.wav,I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
sample-001022.wav,AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
sample-001023.wav,WHY'D YOU WANT TO SAVE ME
sample-001024.wav,BUT WE'VE NEVER HAD ANY REAL TROUBLE
sample-001025.wav,HIS HEART SQUEEZED AS IF HIS CHEST HAD SUDDENLY COMPRESSED IT
sample-001026.wav,THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sample-001027.wav,HE WAS SURE THE GIRL WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND
sample-001028.wav,WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT
sample-001029.wav,EVERY PURCHASE IS A VOTE
sample-001030.wav,I WONDER WHAT MOLLY PUT IN THOSE TACOS
sample-001031.wav,THERE'S MILLIONS OF WAYS
sample-001032.wav,AND THERE WERE DUNES ROCKS AND PLANTS THAT INSISTED ON LIVING WHERE SURVIVAL SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
sample-001033.wav,THE LENS WAS HEAVY BUT IT HAD AN AMAZING ZOOM
sample-001034.wav,YOU SAID IT TO ME TOO
sample-001035.wav,HE WANTS ME TO WRITE DOWN ONLY THINGS THAT I THINK ABOUT BUT NOT THINGS I PLAN TO DO
sample-001036.wav,AND ALL'S FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR
sample-001037.wav,BUT NO ONE ACTUALLY SAW HER DIE
sample-001038.wav,THE BOY WAS BECOMING NERVOUS
sample-001039.wav,HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
sample-001040.wav,I SAW HIM GET IT
sample-001041.wav,A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT SEVERAL LANGUAGES WERE SPOKEN IN THE SHOP
sample-001042.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
sample-001043.wav,ESPECIALLY WITH AN ELECTION COMING UP IN A FEW DAYS
sample-001044.wav,THE FOOL FLEW ALL THE WAY UP HERE IN A BLIZZARD
sample-001045.wav,HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS
sample-001046.wav,IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
sample-001047.wav,SUDDENLY THE ELDER AT THE CENTER SMILED ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY AND THE BOY FELT BETTER
sample-001048.wav,HE REGRETTED HAVING SPOKEN TO THE CAMEL DRIVER ABOUT WHAT HE HAD SEEN IN THE DESERT
sample-001049.wav,BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE A GREEN FIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME
sample-001050.wav,THEY SEEMED TO LAUGH AT HIM AND HE LAUGHED BACK HIS HEART BURSTING WITH JOY
sample-001051.wav,WE'LL SAVE THEM FOR SEED
sample-001052.wav,THEY WERE PEOPLE OF THE DESERT AND CLAMORED TO HEAR HIS STORIES ABOUT THE GREAT CITIES
sample-001053.wav,I'LL BE RIGHT HERE
sample-001054.wav,HE TURNED ON THE MICROPHONE JUST AS THE HEN WAS READY TO SQUAWK
sample-001055.wav,THE BOY BEGAN TO DIG INTO THE DUNE
sample-001056.wav,AND FOR WISE MEN GOLD IS THE METAL THAT EVOLVED THE FURTHEST
sample-001057.wav,I SAY WE DON'T GO OUT ANY MORE
sample-001058.wav,ASK THE OWNER OF THAT STALL HOW MUCH THE SWORD COSTS HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND
sample-001059.wav,BECAUSE ITS GROWTH HORMONE RUNS AWAY FROM SUNLIGHT
sample-001060.wav,LEMON TREES ARE NOT YELLOW IT'S JUST THE FRUIT
sample-001061.wav,NEVER MIND THOSE GUYS
sample-001062.wav,THEY CALLED THAT DISCOVERY THE MASTER WORK  IT WAS PART LIQUID AND PART SOLID
sample-001063.wav,I WOULDN'T BE A BIT SURPRISED
sample-001064.wav,VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TENT
sample-001065.wav,HE DIDN'T WANT HIS HAND TO BEGIN TREMBLING SHOWING THE OLD WOMAN THAT HE WAS FEARFUL
sample-001066.wav,IN A LITTLE WHILE
sample-001067.wav,A WHILE AGO I RODE THROUGH THE DESERT WITH A MAN WHO HAD BOOKS ON ALCHEMY
sample-001068.wav,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sample-001069.wav,I GUESS YOU FORGOT SOMETHING
sample-001070.wav,I CAN'T LET YOU HAVE MY PLANE
sample-001071.wav,THE ALCHEMIST KNOCKED ON THE GATE OF THE MONASTERY
sample-001072.wav,THAT MAKES SENSE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-001073.wav,I'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE
sample-001074.wav,HE FOLLOWED THE MOVEMENT OF THE BIRDS TRYING TO READ SOMETHING INTO IT
sample-001075.wav,BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sample-001076.wav,I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CHANGE
sample-001077.wav,I WANT YOU TO HELP ME TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY ANSWERED
sample-001078.wav,YOU SHOULD SHOW THAT YOUR METHOD IMPROVES RESULTS
sample-001079.wav,TICKETS FOR THE BROADCAST ARE ALL GONE
sample-001080.wav,I KNOW WHY I WANT TO GET BACK TO MY FLOCK HE THOUGHT
sample-001081.wav,CONTINUE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PYRAMIDS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001082.wav,I AM IN SEARCH OF THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AMONG OTHER THINGS
sample-001083.wav,AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
sample-001084.wav,OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
sample-001085.wav,IF IT WERE HE WOULD ALREADY HAVE HEARD OF IT
sample-001086.wav,I'M GOING INTO THE DESERT THE MAN ANSWERED TURNING BACK TO HIS READING
sample-001087.wav,IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sample-001088.wav,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sample-001089.wav,IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE HAD BEEN HERE AND LEFT HIS MARK HE THOUGHT
sample-001090.wav,THERE WAS A FULL MOON AND THE BOY TOLD THE ENGLISHMAN THE STORY OF HIS LIFE
sample-001091.wav,THE HORSE REARED AGAIN RAISING A CLOUD OF DUST
sample-001092.wav,DID SHE DISCUSS IT WITH YOU
sample-001093.wav,HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WRONG
sample-001094.wav,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
sample-001095.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
sample-001096.wav,THE BOY HAD NEVER EVEN NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A HOLE IN HIS POUCH
sample-001097.wav,THE BOY FELT A PANG IN HIS HEART THINKING ABOUT THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
sample-001098.wav,THE WIND BEGAN TO PICK UP
sample-001099.wav,NO ONE ATTACKS AN OASIS
sample-001100.wav,I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS
sample-001101.wav,WHERE ARE THEY GONE
sample-001102.wav,THE REFERENCES ARE GOOD IN THE VERY NARROW AREA OF HISTOGRAM METHODS
sample-001103.wav,I CAN'T DO THAT
sample-001104.wav,IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
sample-001105.wav,IT'S AS MUCH MY FAULT AS YOURS
sample-001106.wav,AS NICE AS BLAKE'S
sample-001107.wav,MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
sample-001108.wav,WHY WOULD A KING BE TALKING WITH A SHEPHERD THE BOY ASKED AWED AND EMBARRASSED
sample-001109.wav,THEY BOTH SPOKE THE SAME LANGUAGE
sample-001110.wav,THEY WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GOLD HIS COMPANION ANSWERED
sample-001111.wav,IT SAID THAT THE DARKEST HOUR OF THE NIGHT CAME JUST BEFORE THE DAWN
sample-001112.wav,I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sample-001113.wav,AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
sample-001114.wav,YOU HAVE DEVELOPED A SERIOUS CASE OF PNEUMONIA
sample-001115.wav,I'M SURE SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT
sample-001116.wav,YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT DESK OUT
sample-001117.wav,WHO TOLD YOU THAT ASKED THE BOY STARTLED
sample-001118.wav,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sample-001119.wav,WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
sample-001120.wav,I DIDN'T KNOW WHOSE IT WAS
sample-001121.wav,NOT TO WORRY SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001122.wav,BRENT'S OPENING ATTACK ON THE GOVERNOR
sample-001123.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sample-001124.wav,ENOUGH SAID THE BOY
sample-001125.wav,IT'S JUST LIKE ANY OTHER DAY AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
sample-001126.wav,HE MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID ENCOUNTERS WITH THIEVES
sample-001127.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-001128.wav,SHE LOOKS AS THOUGH SHE'S GOING TO COME TO
sample-001129.wav,ELIZABETH CHARLES IS DEAD
sample-001130.wav,ITS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE SHE LAST READ CHEKHOV AND BECAUSE OF THAT SHE NO LONGER FEELS LIKE THE HEROINE OF HER OWN STORY
sample-001131.wav,YOU DON'T DENY THAT
sample-001132.wav,THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sample-001133.wav,HE WAS GOING TO MISS THE PLACE AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS HE HAD LEARNED
sample-001134.wav,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sample-001135.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sample-001136.wav,THE SUN THOUGHT FOR A MINUTE
sample-001137.wav,HE CONDEMNED THE COMMANDER TO DEATH WITHOUT HONOR
sample-001138.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sample-001139.wav,WHAT AM I GOING TO SAY TO ELVIS
sample-001140.wav,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
sample-001141.wav,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
sample-001142.wav,I'M NOT GOING VERY FAR THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE HORSEMEN
sample-001143.wav,HE UNDERSTANDS THE FORCES OF NATURE
sample-001144.wav,AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
sample-001145.wav,IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO THE BOY TO FLEE
sample-001146.wav,BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
sample-001147.wav,EXCEPT FOR THE DREAM
sample-001148.wav,THE XYLOPHONE WOULD JUST BE A GLOCKENSPIEL IF IT WASN'T SO METAL
sample-001149.wav,PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
sample-001150.wav,YOU JUMP I JUMP
sample-001151.wav,BY THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION I SAW THEM STAGGERING AND FALLING AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TURNING TO RUN
sample-001152.wav,HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
sample-001153.wav,NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sample-001154.wav,HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
sample-001155.wav,THE BOY COULD CERTAINLY RESIST CAUSING THAT KIND OF ANXIETY FOR THE BAKER
sample-001156.wav,HOW DO YOU MEAN
sample-001157.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sample-001158.wav,THE OLD MAN WORE A BREASTPLATE OF GOLD AND HE KNEW ABOUT MY PAST
sample-001159.wav,I DIDN'T COME HERE TO HAVE YOU READ MY PALM HE SAID ALREADY REGRETTING HAVING COME
sample-001160.wav,WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
sample-001161.wav,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sample-001162.wav,THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
sample-001163.wav,AND HE IMMEDIATELY FELT PEACE IN HIS HEART
sample-001164.wav,ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sample-001165.wav,HAVE A GOOD TIME
sample-001166.wav,THE ONE YOU MARRY HAS GOT TO SWIM RIVERS FOR YOU
sample-001167.wav,WELL USUALLY I LEARN MORE FROM MY SHEEP THAN FROM BOOKS HE ANSWERED
sample-001168.wav,WE REJOICED AT THE CITADEL
sample-001169.wav,SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
sample-001170.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-001171.wav,WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU
sample-001172.wav,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
sample-001173.wav,A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sample-001174.wav,BUT THE MARKETPLACE WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS FAR FROM HOME SO HE WEPT
sample-001175.wav,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
sample-001176.wav,I SAID GOOD NIGHT
sample-001177.wav,PEOPLE SAY STRANGE THINGS THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-001178.wav,I SUPPOSE I COULD
sample-001179.wav,TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRENT DREAM TOO
sample-001180.wav,THE FIRST DAY PASSED
sample-001181.wav,WHERE WAS HIS HORSE
sample-001182.wav,MEANWHILE THE OLD MAN PERSISTED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION
sample-001183.wav,AIDING AN ESCAPED CRIMINAL
sample-001184.wav,IF YOU CAN CONCENTRATE ALWAYS ON THE PRESENT YOU'LL BE A HAPPY MAN
sample-001185.wav,I SAW HIM GET IT
sample-001186.wav,THEY ATE IN SILENCE
sample-001187.wav,NICE TO MEET YOU
sample-001188.wav,THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS OGILVY AND HENDERSON HAD LEFT IT
sample-001189.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
sample-001190.wav,THERE WAS NO WAY TO MEASURE ANYTHING OF THAT LENGTH
sample-001191.wav,IS IT ALL RIGHT
sample-001192.wav,CAN YOU SEE WHAT IS BEYOND THE GOLDEN BIRCHES 
sample-001193.wav,THEY'RE STARTING TO THROW THINGS
sample-001194.wav,WE'VE DONE IT SAID THE ENGLISHMAN WHO HAD ALSO AWAKENED EARLY
sample-001195.wav,TAKING THE JACKET OUT HE BEGAN TO CLEAN THE GLASSES
sample-001196.wav,THOSE ARE THE RULES OF WAR THE LEADER EXPLAINED
sample-001197.wav,IT'S A MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS NATURE AND THE WORLD
sample-001198.wav,THAT'S ALL I ASK
sample-001199.wav,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sample-001200.wav,THE SWORD DIDN'T FALL
sample-001201.wav,IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHO HAD THE RIGHT OF WAY SINCE THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS WERE OFF
sample-001202.wav,YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sample-001203.wav,SHE KNOWS THAT MEN HAVE TO GO AWAY IN ORDER TO RETURN
sample-001204.wav,THIS IS FROM THE GOVERNOR
sample-001205.wav,I'M GOING TO GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE DESERT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sample-001206.wav,NOW YOU GOT ME
sample-001207.wav,CAN I HAVE ONE OF THOSE

sample-001211.wav,EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY THE SAME HAND
sample-001212.wav,I'VE GOT TO GET KATIE OUT OF JAIL
sample-001213.wav,MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
sample-001214.wav,REPLACE THE TS IN TIM TEBOW'S NAME WITH ANY OTHER CONSONANT TO GET A STAR WARS CHARACTER
sample-001215.wav,WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
sample-001216.wav,IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE THE LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
sample-001217.wav,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER

sample-001221.wav,THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sample-001222.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
sample-001223.wav,THE YEARS OF RESEARCH THE MAGIC SYMBOLS THE STRANGE WORDS AND THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT
sample-001224.wav,BUT I FELT MISERABLE WATCHING HIM WITHER AWAY LIKE A SHRIVELED DANDELION
sample-001225.wav,LOOKING AROUND HE SOUGHT HIS SHEEP AND THEN REALIZED THAT HE WAS IN A NEW WORLD
sample-001226.wav,THOSE ARE THE RULES OF WAR THE LEADER EXPLAINED
sample-001227.wav,WHY DIDN'T I CALL YOU BACK
sample-001228.wav,IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sample-001229.wav,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sample-001230.wav,THAT'S RIGHT SAID THE OLD MAN ABLE TO READ THE BOY'S THOUGHTS

sample-001232.wav,THEN YOU'LL DIE IN THE MIDST OF TRYING TO REALIZE YOUR DESTINY
sample-001233.wav,I LOCKED EYES WITH A FISH IN THE TANK
sample-001234.wav,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
sample-001235.wav,THE DRIVERS CARRIED THE FREIGHT THEMSELVES OVER SUCH TREACHEROUS FOOTING AND THEN RELOADED THE CAMELS
sample-001236.wav,THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP
sample-001237.wav,HE LEFT WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE TO THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
sample-001238.wav,BUT CAN WE TRUST HIM

sample-001259.wav,THAT TINA THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY
sample-001260.wav,AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE WOMAN HE LOVED
sample-001261.wav,THE ANIMALS WERE EXHAUSTED AND THE MEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES LESS AND LESS
sample-001262.wav,THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN
sample-001263.wav,HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
sample-001264.wav,WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE THINGS MAKE EVEN MORE SENSE HE THOUGHT

sample-001279.wav,THE QUICKER THE BETTER
sample-001280.wav,HE CALLED TO THE BOY AND THEY TOOK A WALK ALONG THE DUNES SURROUNDING THE ENCAMPMENT
sample-001281.wav,HE RESTARTED HIS EFFORTS FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME
sample-001282.wav,SHE GAVE THEM EACH A HALF TO MAKE THEM WORK TOGETHER
sample-001283.wav,WHO GETS YOUR VOTE
sample-001284.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
sample-001285.wav,IT WAS SPRAYED IN RED WITH YELLOW EDGES
sample-001286.wav,ALL THEY THINK ABOUT IS FOOD AND WATER
sample-001287.wav,WE'LL FIND YOU A HOTEL
sample-001288.wav,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sample-001289.wav,THE TREASURE IS AT THE PYRAMIDS THAT YOU ALREADY KNEW
sample-001290.wav,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sample-001291.wav,IT MUST BE SOME KIND OF A GAG
sample-001292.wav,SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP
sample-001293.wav,I KNOW SHE WRITES THEM
sample-001294.wav,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sample-001295.wav,IT WOULD KILL YOU
sample-001296.wav,THE SUN THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND DECIDED TO SHINE MORE BRIGHTLY
sample-001297.wav,YOU'RE IN LUCK YOU TWO THE FAT ARAB SAID
sample-001298.wav,IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
sample-001299.wav,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
sample-001300.wav,MAYBE BECAUSE THAT WASN'T REALLY HIS DREAM
sample-001301.wav,HE HAD NEVER EVEN WEPT IN FRONT OF HIS OWN SHEEP
sample-001302.wav,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sample-001303.wav,BY THE LIGHT OF THEIR OWN DESTRUCTION I SAW THEM STAGGERING AND FALLING AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TURNING TO RUN
sample-001304.wav,BUT DON'T WORRY THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED
sample-001305.wav,THEN TAKING HIS SHEEP HE WALKED AWAY
sample-001306.wav,BEFORE THE BOY COULD REPLY A BUTTERFLY APPEARED AND FLUTTERED BETWEEN HIM AND THE OLD MAN
sample-001307.wav,I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES
sample-001308.wav,IT WAS EARLY MORNING WHEN SHE WOKE UP
sample-001309.wav,IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HERE
sample-001310.wav,YOU'LL GET YOUR MONEY IN SIXTY DAYS
sample-001311.wav,HE WAS PLANNING AS HE LEFT THE BAR
sample-001312.wav,IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TALKING TO HIS SHEEP
sample-001313.wav,NO HE HEARD A VOICE ON THE WIND SAY
sample-001314.wav,PATRICK HAS TERMINAL CANCER
sample-001315.wav,THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
sample-001316.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-001317.wav,WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF THE METHOD IN TERMS OF IDENTIFICATION ACCURACY
sample-001318.wav,THERE'S NO DANGER THE BOY SAID WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON PAST THE ENCAMPMENT
sample-001319.wav,I HAD NEVER HEARD OF ALCHEMISTS BEFORE THE BOY SAID
sample-001320.wav,I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sample-001321.wav,A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
sample-001322.wav,HE DREW ON THE BACK OF HIS JACKET WITH A BLUE FOUNTAIN PEN
sample-001323.wav,THERE WERE THIRTY GIRLS ON THE SOCCER FIELD
sample-001324.wav,THAT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
sample-001325.wav,EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW YOU HAVE LEARNED THROUGH YOUR JOURNEY
sample-001326.wav,IT WAS BETTER THAN THE SCENT OF THE HOOKAHS
sample-001327.wav,THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sample-001328.wav,I COULD EAT A HORSE
sample-001329.wav,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sample-001330.wav,WE NEED TO RUN
sample-001331.wav,I TOLD YOU TO PRACTICE
sample-001332.wav,ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS
sample-001333.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
sample-001334.wav,FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
sample-001335.wav,IT WAS THE PURE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
sample-001336.wav,ANOTHER TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-001337.wav,SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
sample-001338.wav,YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM YOUR HEART
sample-001339.wav,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
sample-001340.wav,HE TOOK BACK HIS BOOKS AND PACKED THEM AWAY AGAIN IN THEIR BAGS
sample-001341.wav,YOU'VE GOT JUST TEN MINUTES
sample-001342.wav,THAT SONG REMINDS ME OF MY CHILDHOOD
sample-001343.wav,THE LITTLE GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM THE CITY DISPERSED
sample-001344.wav,TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRENT DREAM TOO
sample-001345.wav,HE CALLED TO THE BOY AND THEY TOOK A WALK ALONG THE DUNES SURROUNDING THE ENCAMPMENT
sample-001346.wav,WHEN SHE SAW THE UNKNOWN OBJECT BOBBING UP AND DOWN THE EDGE SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED
sample-001347.wav,IT'S THE MASTER WORK OF THE ALCHEMISTS
sample-001348.wav,TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sample-001349.wav,BUT HE KEPT QUIET BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD WHAT THE ALCHEMIST SAID TO THE MONK
sample-001350.wav,THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
sample-001351.wav,FATIMA APPEARED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TENT
sample-001352.wav,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
sample-001353.wav,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
sample-001354.wav,HAVE YOU NOTIFIED THE POLICE
sample-001355.wav,I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FEELING
sample-001356.wav,TEN MINUTES FOR WHAT
sample-001357.wav,WHOM ARE YOU CALLING NOW
sample-001358.wav,BUT THE MERCHANT UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY HAD SAID
sample-001359.wav,HIS SOUL MUST BE TOO PRIMITIVE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS HE THOUGHT
sample-001360.wav,WHO IS THIS STRANGER WHO SPEAKS OF OMENS ASKED ONE OF THE CHIEFTAINS EYEING THE BOY
sample-001361.wav,THEN YOU'LL DIE IN THE MIDST OF TRYING TO REALIZE YOUR DESTINY
sample-001362.wav,THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
sample-001363.wav,THEY RODE FOR THE ENTIRE DAY
sample-001364.wav,THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS KNAPSACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANK SOME
sample-001365.wav,I WAS SENT DOWN HERE TO CLEAN HOUSE
sample-001366.wav,HE WANTED YOUR MONEY HE SAID
sample-001367.wav,IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
sample-001368.wav,I THINK WE WERE WRONG ABOUT SALLY HAVING THE MONEY
sample-001369.wav,HE WAS TWENTY MINUTES FROM HIS TENT AND BEGAN TO MAKE HIS WAY THERE
sample-001370.wav,IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
sample-001371.wav,I WANT MY HUSBAND TO WANDER AS FREE AS THE WIND THAT SHAPES THE DUNES
sample-001372.wav,A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
sample-001373.wav,YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE IN A LOVING WAY AND DIED WITH DIGNITY
sample-001374.wav,HOW MUCH IS IT WORTH
sample-001375.wav,I'LL JUST WATCH HIM HE SAID TO HIMSELF
sample-001376.wav,I'M GOING TO HATE THOSE WHO HAVE FOUND THEIR TREASURE BECAUSE I NEVER FOUND MINE
sample-001377.wav,THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
sample-001378.wav,AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
sample-001379.wav,I THOUGHT THAT WAS PETER PARKER
sample-001380.wav,BUT EVERYTHING HAD CHANGED
sample-001381.wav,AN ALCHEMIST SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001382.wav,YEAH ITS DEFINITELY WORTH CHECKING OUT ESPECIALLY IF THE PAY IS REASONABLE AND THE WORK IS GOOD FOR YOUR CAREER THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COMPANY
sample-001383.wav,I COULD SEE SOMETHING IN THEIR FACES
sample-001384.wav,NO ONE SAID A WORD AS THE OLD MAN CONTINUED
sample-001385.wav,HAVE YOU GOT THAT MONEY
sample-001386.wav,A BREEZE BEGAN TO BLOW
sample-001387.wav,THE CLOCK WAS SLIGHTLY ASKEW
sample-001388.wav,HERE'S TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS
sample-001389.wav,I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
sample-001390.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sample-001391.wav,I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS
sample-001392.wav,SHE'S WRITTEN TO ME EVERY DAY SINCE
sample-001393.wav,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
sample-001394.wav,AT HIS SIDE WAS THE YOUNG ARAB THE BOY HAD SPOKEN WITH EARLIER
sample-001395.wav,LET'S GO AND HAVE SOME LUNCH SAID THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
sample-001396.wav,I'VE HAD THIS SHOP FOR THIRTY YEARS
sample-001397.wav,THERE WAS A MURMUR FROM THE CROWD
sample-001398.wav,WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sample-001399.wav,THE BOY'S HEART BEGAN TO SPEAK OF FEAR
sample-001400.wav,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sample-001401.wav,BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
sample-001402.wav,MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY ALWAYS STAY CLOSE TO ME
sample-001403.wav,WHO YOU HOLDING OUT ON
sample-001404.wav,DON'T WORRY I TOOK A CAB TO GET HOME SAFELY
sample-001405.wav,MY DOG IS AN ALSATIAN WE CALL HER 'POPPY'
sample-001406.wav,FROM ATOP ITS WALLS ONE CAN CATCH A GLIMPSE OF AFRICA
sample-001407.wav,YOU'LL USE YOUR KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WELFARE OF THE OASIS AND ITS INHABITANTS
sample-001408.wav,THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sample-001409.wav,I THINK ITS TOO OVERWHELMING TO INTRODUCE TWO COMPLEX TOOLS THAT BASICALLY DO THE SAME THINGS
sample-001410.wav,YOU'VE GOT THE MAYOR AND PULLMAN BACKED AGAINST A WALL
sample-001411.wav,THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sample-001412.wav,AND HE GAVE THE BOY HIS BLESSING
sample-001413.wav,WHAT'S IN THAT DESK
sample-001414.wav,SO HE ASKED IF THE OLD MAN'S BLESSING WAS STILL WITH HIM
sample-001415.wav,THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
sample-001416.wav,BUT THE BOY COULDN'T EVEN SPEAK
sample-001417.wav,IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE THE LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
sample-001418.wav,WILL YOU GET OUT AND LET ME HANDLE THIS
sample-001419.wav,OUR DEADLINE IS COMING UP RAPIDLY AND WE WILL NEED HELP
sample-001420.wav,BUT THE TRADITION ALSO SAYS THAT WE SHOULD BELIEVE THE MESSAGES OF THE DESERT
sample-001421.wav,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE TO ME HAD I ONLY LOOKED UP AS IT PASSED
sample-001422.wav,AT THE HIGHEST POINT IN TARIFA THERE IS AN OLD FORT BUILT BY THE MOORS
sample-001423.wav,THERE WAS NO NEED TO IMPRISON THEM THE ARABS SIMPLY CONFISCATED THEIR HORSES
sample-001424.wav,ON THE  O'CLOCK TRAIN
sample-001425.wav,THEY ALSO BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THEY KNEW A BETTER WAY THAN OTHERS HAD
sample-001426.wav,MEN DREAM MORE ABOUT COMING HOME THAN ABOUT LEAVING THE BOY SAID
sample-001427.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
sample-001428.wav,BUT HE GRANTED THE TRAVELERS THREE DAYS
sample-001429.wav,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sample-001430.wav,WHOSE TURN IS IT
sample-001431.wav,HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sample-001432.wav,DURING THE THIRD YEAR THE OMENS WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OF YOUR TREASURE AND YOUR DESTINY
sample-001433.wav,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
sample-001434.wav,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sample-001435.wav,YOU'LL FIND US EVERYWHERE
sample-001436.wav,IT WAS THE PURE LANGUAGE OF THE WORLD
sample-001437.wav,THE BATTLES MAY LAST FOR A LONG TIME PERHAPS EVEN YEARS
sample-001438.wav,IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HERE
sample-001439.wav,DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
sample-001440.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sample-001441.wav,LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sample-001442.wav,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sample-001443.wav,PERHAPS SHE MET SOMEBODY
sample-001444.wav,LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
sample-001445.wav,THE SHEPHERD SWORE THAT HE WOULD
sample-001446.wav,THAT LIFE MAY ALWAYS HAVE FLAVOR
sample-001447.wav,NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
sample-001448.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
sample-001449.wav,AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
sample-001450.wav,WE NEED TO HURRY
sample-001451.wav,IT SPOKE OF JOURNEYS DISCOVERIES BOOKS AND CHANGE
sample-001452.wav,HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURN TO HIS MEDITATION
sample-001453.wav,A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sample-001454.wav,IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE THE BOY SAID
sample-001455.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sample-001456.wav,IT SOUNDED LIKE A GYPSY PRAYER
sample-001457.wav,I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
sample-001458.wav,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sample-001459.wav,FIRST THEY TRIED TO FIND HIM ON THEIR OWN
sample-001460.wav,HE SAW THE BOY APPEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DUNES
sample-001461.wav,THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
sample-001462.wav,WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
sample-001463.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sample-001464.wav,WE SHOULD SEGREGATE THE PARTICIPANTS BY AGE
sample-001465.wav,THEN WE CAN CLIMB MT HELEN
sample-001466.wav,AND MAYBE IT WASN'T THAT THEY WERE TEACHING ME BUT THAT I WAS LEARNING FROM THEM
sample-001467.wav,HE WANDERED FOR A WHILE KEEPING THE DATE PALMS OF THE OASIS WITHIN SIGHT
sample-001468.wav,IT WAS BETTER THAN THE SCENT OF THE HOOKAHS
sample-001469.wav,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sample-001470.wav,AND THE ALCHEMIST UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BOY'S HEART HAD RETURNED TO THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
sample-001471.wav,THE WAR CONTINUED AND AT TIMES THE WIND CARRIED THE SWEET SICKLY SMELL OF BLOOD
sample-001472.wav,I TOLD HIM WE COULD TEACH HER TO IGNORE PEOPLE WHO WASTE HER TIME
sample-001473.wav,TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
sample-001474.wav,WHO ARE YOU HE HEARD A VOICE ASK HIM IN SPANISH
sample-001475.wav,WE'VE GOT TO PRODUCE A SHOW NOW
sample-001476.wav,YES OR EVEN SEARCH FOR TREASURE
sample-001477.wav,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
sample-001478.wav,AND HE HADN'T PERCEIVED THEM BECAUSE HE HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THEM
sample-001479.wav,THEN I DON'T GET PAID
sample-001480.wav,SHE ACCUSED AN EXCONVICT OF STALKING AND SEXUAL ASSAULT
sample-001481.wav,THEN I'VE ONLY GOT AN HOUR TO DRESS
sample-001482.wav,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sample-001483.wav,IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE WAR IS OVER THEN WAIT
sample-001484.wav,HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
sample-001485.wav,THE PILOTS BRACED THEMSELVES FOR IMPACT
sample-001486.wav,MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sample-001487.wav,THE MEN OF THE DESERT WERE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THAT WIND
sample-001488.wav,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-001489.wav,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
sample-001490.wav,HOW DO YOU LIKE HER
sample-001491.wav,A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES
sample-001492.wav,THE MERCHANT WAS SILENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS
sample-001493.wav,I'LL GIVE IT A DRINK
sample-001494.wav,HOW LONG IS WHAT
sample-001495.wav,THE ALCHEMIST WAS A BIT DAUNTING BUT AS THE BOY DRANK THE WINE HE RELAXED
sample-001496.wav,THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS
sample-001497.wav,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
sample-001498.wav,REMEMBER THE INTERVIEW I WROTE WITH ALICE WELLMAN
sample-001499.wav,HOW DO YOU MEAN
sample-001500.wav,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
sample-001501.wav,I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
sample-001502.wav,FOR YOUR FIRST INSTALLATION I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING THEIR PREPACKAGED VERSION OF PYTHON TO AVOID TROUBLE
sample-001503.wav,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sample-001504.wav,TAKE THAT FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND PUT OUT THE FIRE
sample-001505.wav,OTHERS STUMBLED UPON THE STONE BY ACCIDENT
sample-001506.wav,AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
sample-001507.wav,AND HE GAVE THE BOY HIS BLESSING
sample-001508.wav,STICK TO YOUR CLUBS
sample-001509.wav,MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
sample-001510.wav,LAST TIME I MADE THE MISTAKE OF REPLICATING A DRAWING BY RODIN
sample-001511.wav,TAKING THE JACKET OUT HE BEGAN TO CLEAN THE GLASSES
sample-001512.wav,HE HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE SOMEONE AS CAPABLE AS HIS PREVIOUS APPRENTICE
sample-001513.wav,THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sample-001514.wav,THE SHIRT OFF MY BACK
sample-001515.wav,THE DESERT WITH ITS ENDLESS MONOTONY PUT HIM TO DREAMING
sample-001516.wav,IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MIRACLE
sample-001517.wav,SHE LOOKS KIND OF BORED
sample-001518.wav,SHE'S A FEISTY LITTLE FERRET
sample-001519.wav,IT'S THE NAME OF THE PROPHET'S DAUGHTER FATIMA SAID
sample-001520.wav,THE TERRORIST GROUP MADE THEIR DEMAND
sample-001521.wav,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
sample-001522.wav,AND SO DO I
sample-001523.wav,I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
sample-001524.wav,HE EXPERTLY GUTTED THE RABBIT
sample-001525.wav,AS THEY BEGAN TO DECORATE THE HALLWAY A SILHOUETTE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
sample-001526.wav,WHEN DID YOU ARRIVE IN TOWN
sample-001527.wav,AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS THE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCES THAT IS TO SAY INPUTS
sample-001528.wav,BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO REALIZE YOUR DESTINY
sample-001529.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sample-001530.wav,THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sample-001531.wav,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sample-001532.wav,SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
sample-001533.wav,WOULD YOU LIKE A CAPPUCCINO
sample-001534.wav,DO YOU THINK STEVEN WOULD HAVE LET YOU KEEP IT
sample-001535.wav,BUT A LOVELY CHAP
sample-001536.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sample-001537.wav,HE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT IN TARIFA THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO INTERPRETED DREAMS
sample-001538.wav,THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE MAN'S CLOTHING WAS STRANGE
sample-001539.wav,TOMORROW AT THIS SAME TIME BRING ME A TENTH OF YOUR FLOCK
sample-001540.wav,I CAN SEE THAT
sample-001541.wav,THE ALCHEMIST WAS A BIT DAUNTING BUT AS THE BOY DRANK THE WINE HE RELAXED
sample-001542.wav,THERE WERE RAISED VOICESAND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON 
sample-001543.wav,CLASS WAS DISMISSED DUE TO A FREAK INCIDENT CAUSED BY A CHEMICAL SPILL
sample-001544.wav,IT WAS DIFFICULT NOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HE HAD LEFT BEHIND
sample-001545.wav,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
sample-001546.wav,IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO THE BOY TO FLEE
sample-001547.wav,BUT SHE IS GONE
sample-001548.wav,I DON'T BELIEVE IT
sample-001549.wav,HE SPENT THE ENTIRE MORNING OBSERVING THE INFREQUENT COMINGS AND GOINGS IN THE STREET
sample-001550.wav,YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
sample-001551.wav,SUDDENLY THE ELDER AT THE CENTER SMILED ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY AND THE BOY FELT BETTER
sample-001552.wav,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
sample-001553.wav,ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
sample-001554.wav,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
sample-001555.wav,IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
sample-001556.wav,I GUESS I USED ALL THE SHELLS
sample-001557.wav,THEY CAN'T DO THAT TO ME
sample-001558.wav,AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
sample-001559.wav,AND YET NONE OF THESE PEOPLE HAS EVER MET THE OLD KING
sample-001560.wav,HE DISAPPEARED INTO THE TENT
sample-001561.wav,HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO WORK FOR ME
sample-001562.wav,THIS WAS MY DESTINY NOT YOURS THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-001563.wav,LATER WE SIMPLY LET LIFE PROCEED IN ITS OWN DIRECTION TOWARD ITS OWN FATE
sample-001564.wav,A PILE OF SOFT ASHES COATED HER BODY AND FILLED HER NOSTRILS
sample-001565.wav,THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FALLING STAR
sample-001566.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sample-001567.wav,YOU MUST ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sample-001568.wav,PEOPLE SAID THAT GYPSIES SPENT THEIR LIVES TRICKING OTHERS
sample-001569.wav,HE WANTED TO TELL HIM ABOUT FATIMA
sample-001570.wav,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
sample-001571.wav,AS THEY SAT DOWN AT THE ONLY TABLE IN THE PLACE THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT LAUGHED
sample-001572.wav,THE GODS SHOULD NOT HAVE DESIRES BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE DESTINIES
sample-001573.wav,IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
sample-001574.wav,MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
sample-001575.wav,I'M TERRIBLY SORRY SHE ISN'T HERE
sample-001576.wav,SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sample-001577.wav,I'M OBSERVING PASSIVEAGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR THE PSYCHOLOGIST SAID IN A PROFESSIONAL TONE
sample-001578.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING
sample-001579.wav,THAT FIRST DAY EVERYONE SLEPT FROM EXHAUSTION INCLUDING THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-001580.wav,THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
sample-001581.wav,HOW DO PEOPLE CELEBRATE GOOD WEATHER OVER THERE
sample-001582.wav,I JUST GOT RID OF ONE CROWD
sample-001583.wav,AND I WILL TELL YOU HOW TO FIND THE HIDDEN TREASURE
sample-001584.wav,THEY ALSO BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THEY KNEW A BETTER WAY THAN OTHERS HAD
sample-001585.wav,THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION
sample-001586.wav,FATIMA WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS TREASURE
sample-001587.wav,AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001588.wav,WHEN THE SIMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN
sample-001589.wav,THE BOY LOOKED OUT AT THE HORIZON
sample-001590.wav,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sample-001591.wav,EVEN ME  I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF OTHER WOMEN SINCE I MET THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
sample-001592.wav,THEY RAISED THEIR GLASSES IN THE OLD BAR
sample-001593.wav,HIS LIFE AND HIS PATH HAD ALWAYS PROVIDED HIM WITH ENOUGH OMENS
sample-001594.wav,HE CALLED TO THE BOY AND THEY TOOK A WALK ALONG THE DUNES SURROUNDING THE ENCAMPMENT
sample-001595.wav,THE REPORT WAS LARGELY SCATHING
sample-001596.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-001597.wav,THAT'S THE BEST PART OF IT

sample-001621.wav,INSTEAD THE STRANGER LOWERED IT SLOWLY UNTIL THE POINT TOUCHED THE BOY'S FOREHEAD
sample-001622.wav,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sample-001623.wav,AND HE GAVE THE BOY HIS BLESSING

sample-001625.wav,SHOULD I UNDERSTAND THE EMERALD TABLET THE BOY ASKED
sample-001626.wav,WAIT TILL THOSE TWO FUTURE JAILBIRDS READ THE MORNING POST TOMORROW

sample-001629.wav,THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
sample-001630.wav,THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
sample-001631.wav,I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
sample-001632.wav,HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
sample-001633.wav,THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
sample-001634.wav,AND I'M CERTAIN YOU'LL FIND IT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sample-001635.wav,A WHILE AGO I RODE THROUGH THE DESERT WITH A MAN WHO HAD BOOKS ON ALCHEMY
sample-001636.wav,HE SLIPPED ON THE STAIRS
sample-001637.wav,IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
sample-001638.wav,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
sample-001639.wav,IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS WINE HE HAD EVER TASTED
sample-001640.wav,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sample-001641.wav,THE ALCHEMIST DISMOUNTED SLOWLY AND THE BOY DID THE SAME
sample-001642.wav,I WAS TORN BETWEEN FEAR AND CURIOSITY
sample-001643.wav,HIS SOUL MUST BE TOO PRIMITIVE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS HE THOUGHT
sample-001644.wav,WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MIRANDA
sample-001645.wav,THE BOY WENT TO THE WELL EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH FATIMA
sample-001646.wav,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
sample-001647.wav,KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON
sample-001648.wav,WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS THERE ALSO WILL BE YOUR HEART THE ALCHEMIST HAD TOLD HIM
sample-001649.wav,WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
sample-001650.wav,THEN WHO ARE YOU
sample-001651.wav,HE APPEARED WITH THE FIRST STARS OF EVENING
sample-001652.wav,I HAVEN'T ANY HARD FEELINGS
sample-001653.wav,THEY SEEMED TO LAUGH AT HIM AND HE LAUGHED BACK HIS HEART BURSTING WITH JOY

sample-001655.wav,WHEN WERE THESE BOOKS WRITTEN THE BOY ASKED
sample-001656.wav,THEY'RE ALWAYS AFTER ME FOR INTERVIEWS
sample-001657.wav,NOT THAT I WAS LISTENING BUT I NOTICED THAT YOU SOUNDED REALLY STRESSED WHEN YOU WERE EXPLAINING THE SITUATION TO HIM
sample-001658.wav,WHAT IS A FOREIGNER DOING HERE ASKED ANOTHER OF THE MEN
sample-001659.wav,BUT WHEN THE REIGN OF TIBERIUS ENDED HIS POEMS WERE FORGOTTEN
sample-001660.wav,BECAUSE LIFE WANTS YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR DESTINY
sample-001661.wav,WANT TO WALK TO NEW YORK
sample-001662.wav,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
sample-001663.wav,I LEFT MY FATHER MY MOTHER AND THE TOWN CASTLE BEHIND
sample-001664.wav,WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT
sample-001665.wav,DID YOU BRING THE CHRISTMAS WREATH

sample-001669.wav,GIVE ME PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO DECONTAMINATE THE TROOPER
sample-001670.wav,THE ALIEN GURGLED AND THRASHED ITS TENTACLES
sample-001671.wav,WHO ENGINEERED THIS GETAWAY
sample-001672.wav,WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
sample-001673.wav,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sample-001674.wav,WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING
sample-001675.wav,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
sample-001676.wav,THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
sample-001677.wav,THE DESERT DIDN'T ANSWER HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS
sample-001678.wav,NEXT MORNING THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND ARMED MEN SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE PALM TREES AT AL FAYOUM
sample-001679.wav,AND HE ASKED THE BOY IF HE TOO WERE IN SEARCH OF THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001680.wav,ONLY IN THAT WAY WOULD HE BE ABLE TO READ THE OMENS
sample-001681.wav,ONE THAT WILL WRITE
sample-001682.wav,FROM HERE ON YOU WILL BE ALONE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sample-001683.wav,I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
sample-001684.wav,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
sample-001685.wav,EVERY DAY WAS THERE TO BE LIVED OR TO MARK ONE'S DEPARTURE FROM THIS WORLD
sample-001686.wav,HE TRIED AGAIN TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PINK SHADES OF THE DESERT AND ITS STONES
sample-001687.wav,HE REALLY WAS A KING
sample-001688.wav,OUR GENERATOR HAS BEEN DISRUPTED BY ULTRA HIGH FREQUENCY WAVES
sample-001689.wav,SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP
sample-001690.wav,THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD AT ATTENTION
sample-001691.wav,ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
sample-001692.wav,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sample-001693.wav,THAT WAS THE LAW OF HOSPITALITY
sample-001694.wav,THAT FIRST DAY EVERYONE SLEPT FROM EXHAUSTION INCLUDING THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-001695.wav,BUT SHE SAID NOTHING
sample-001696.wav,THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
sample-001697.wav,THE STRANGE HORSEMAN DREW AN ENORMOUS CURVED SWORD FROM A SCABBARD MOUNTED ON HIS SADDLE
sample-001698.wav,I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH CHANGE
sample-001699.wav,THEY'LL TAKE CARE OF IT
sample-001700.wav,I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
sample-001701.wav,AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
sample-001702.wav,HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
sample-001703.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
sample-001704.wav,I FINALLY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AND ALL THE TIME I NEED
sample-001705.wav,THE CEILING COLLAPSED INWARDS
sample-001706.wav,WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT OMENS THE BOY'S INTEREST WAS INCREASING BY THE MOMENT
sample-001707.wav,THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
sample-001708.wav,THERE IS A WHOLE LOT OF JOY IN PLAYING PIANO
sample-001709.wav,I'LL RETURN JUST AS YOUR FATHER CAME BACK TO YOUR MOTHER HE SAID
sample-001710.wav,BETTER TO GET HALF THAN NOTHING
sample-001711.wav,ALFAYOUM IS IN EGYPT SAID THE ARAB
sample-001712.wav,WEARING HIS NEW SANDALS HE DESCENDED THE STAIRS SILENTLY
sample-001713.wav,THERE WAS A GENERAL MOVEMENT BACKWARDS
sample-001714.wav,MAYBE WE'D BETTER CALL HERMAN
sample-001715.wav,IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sample-001716.wav,THE OLD MAN SAID NOTHING
sample-001717.wav,IT'S EVEN HIGHER THAN THIS
sample-001718.wav,THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER
sample-001719.wav,I'M AFRAID IT IS IMPORTANT
sample-001720.wav,NOBODY'S TRYING TO STEAL FROM YOU
sample-001721.wav,I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT DREAMS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001722.wav,THE OLD MAN LOOKED DISAPPOINTED
sample-001723.wav,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
sample-001724.wav,I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sample-001725.wav,THE BOY BEGAN TO DIG INTO THE DUNE
sample-001726.wav,NEIGHBORS MOVED AWAY AND THERE REMAINED ONLY A FEW SMALL SHOPS ON THE HILL
sample-001727.wav,THE SAME BOOK THAT TAUGHT ME ABOUT URIM AND THUMMIM
sample-001728.wav,EVENTUALLY THE MERCHANT HAD TO HIRE TWO MORE EMPLOYEES
sample-001729.wav,TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY I MUST HAVE NO FEAR OF FAILURE
sample-001730.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
sample-001731.wav,BUT HE KEPT QUIET BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD WHAT THE ALCHEMIST SAID TO THE MONK
sample-001732.wav,DONT SHARE YOUR OPINIONS SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS LISTENING
sample-001733.wav,SO YOU GOT MARRIED
sample-001734.wav,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
sample-001735.wav,YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME
sample-001736.wav,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
sample-001737.wav,TO SHOW YOU ONE OF LIFE'S SIMPLE LESSONS THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-001738.wav,I'M GOING WITH YOU THE BOY SAID
sample-001739.wav,ITS TOO EARLY TO TELL WHETHER THE STRATEGY WILL PAY OFF
sample-001740.wav,JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM
sample-001741.wav,OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
sample-001742.wav,HE SAW THE BOY APPEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DUNES
sample-001743.wav,THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sample-001744.wav,AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
sample-001745.wav,HE COULD ALWAYS BECOME A CRYSTAL SALESMAN AGAIN
sample-001746.wav,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
sample-001747.wav,THE BOY OFFERED HIS BOTTLE HOPING THAT THE OLD MAN WOULD LEAVE HIM ALONE
sample-001748.wav,THE BOY OFFERED HIS BOTTLE HOPING THAT THE OLD MAN WOULD LEAVE HIM ALONE
sample-001749.wav,THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
sample-001750.wav,IT'S THE ONLY NAME I'VE GOT
sample-001751.wav,THE ONLY THINGS THAT CONCERNED THE SHEEP WERE FOOD AND WATER
sample-001752.wav,AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE
sample-001753.wav,HIS FATHER SAID NO MORE
sample-001754.wav,THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS OGILVY AND HENDERSON HAD LEFT IT
sample-001755.wav,THE OTHER SON WAS A POET AND DELIGHTED ALL OF ROME WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL VERSES
sample-001756.wav,THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD
sample-001757.wav,THE POLICE FINALLY MANAGE TO GET HIM OUT OF THE PARK
sample-001758.wav,HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sample-001759.wav,WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT
sample-001760.wav,HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A STONE THAT ROLLED UP TO THE MINER'S FOOT
sample-001761.wav,FROM THEN ON HE WOULD MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS
sample-001762.wav,I'M GOING TO PUT HER THROUGH COLLEGE
sample-001763.wav,BUT IN HIS HEART HE KNEW THAT IT DID MATTER
sample-001764.wav,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sample-001765.wav,THE MEN WERE TERRIFIED AT HIS SORCERY
sample-001766.wav,LIFE ATTRACTS LIFE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-001767.wav,BUT THIS PAYMENT GOES WELL BEYOND MY GENEROSITY THE MONK RESPONDED
sample-001768.wav,THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FALLING STAR
sample-001769.wav,THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT AT WORK A CAMEL STAMPEDE NEARLY KILLED THE JANITOR
sample-001770.wav,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT

sample-001779.wav,THE DESERT WAS ALL SAND IN SOME STRETCHES AND ROCKY IN OTHERS
sample-001780.wav,BUT A LOVELY CHAP
sample-001781.wav,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sample-001782.wav,AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS
sample-001783.wav,SOMETIMES I APPEAR IN THE FORM OF A SOLUTION OR A GOOD IDEA
sample-001784.wav,SO YOU GOT MARRIED
sample-001785.wav,I WANT MY BABY TO LOOK LIKE YOU

sample-001804.wav,I ASKED HIM TO LET ME USE THE KITCHEN FOR A WHILE THE ALCHEMIST SMILED
sample-001805.wav,THE MUSIC WAS CAPTIVATING
sample-001806.wav,THEY NEVER FOUND THE SECRET
sample-001807.wav,I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE
sample-001808.wav,I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS

sample-002099.wav,I'VE NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE THE MERCHANT ANSWERED
sample-002100.wav,STILL CAN'T CONTACT CONWAY

sample-002116.wav,THIS RECORDING IS CORRUPTED
sample-002117.wav,HE WAS MORE CERTAIN OF IT THAN OF ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
sample-002118.wav,SO WHAT IS SALEM LIKE HE ASKED TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF CLUE

sample-002139.wav,THE INTERNET OF UNCONTROLLED THINGS BROUGHT US A DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACK ONCE AGAIN
sample-002140.wav,AND THE ODOR OF THE ANIMALS BECAME A BIT MORE TOLERABLE

sample-002181.wav,I WANT THOSE STAMPS
sample-002182.wav,THERE WAS NO WAY FOR EVERYBODY TO KNOW ABOUT ALCHEMY
sample-002183.wav,THE WIND'S CURIOSITY WAS AROUSED SOMETHING THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
sample-002184.wav,NEXT MORNING THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND ARMED MEN SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE PALM TREES AT AL FAYOUM
sample-002185.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN

sample-002195.wav,I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
sample-002196.wav,THE BOY THOUGHT OF FATIMA
sample-002197.wav,AND THE ALCHEMIST UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BOY'S HEART HAD RETURNED TO THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
sample-002198.wav,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
sample-002199.wav,SOMEONE SET FIRE TO THE TRASH
sample-002200.wav,THEY'D NEVER LET YOU GO

sample-002212.wav,I GOT TWO GIANT BUG BITES ON MY RIGHT LEG FROM LAST NIGHT AND THEY HURT
sample-002213.wav,WAIT A MINUTE
sample-002214.wav,HE WANTED TO SAY SO TO THE ALCHEMIST BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF THE MAN
sample-002215.wav,THE TWO WALKED OUT AMONG THE PALMS
sample-002216.wav,THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sample-002217.wav,AND SO DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WAS A ROMAN CENTURION HE CONVERTED TO THEIR FAITH
sample-002218.wav,MOZZARELLA IS A CREAMY CHEESE THAT GOES WELL WITH TOMATO AND BASIL
sample-002219.wav,HE'S THE MAN THE ADS ARE WRITTEN FOR
sample-002220.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
sample-002221.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sample-002222.wav,HE MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID ENCOUNTERS WITH THIEVES

sample-002229.wav,AT THAT POINT IN THEIR LIVES EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE
sample-002230.wav,APOLOGIES FOR NOT CALLING YOU BACK
sample-002231.wav,IT TOOK HIM A WHILE TO GET TO THE OFFICE
sample-002232.wav,THE SWAT ENTRY TEAM USED AN OPTICAL WAND TO OBSERVE THE PROCEEDINGS BEHIND THE DOOR
sample-002233.wav,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sample-002234.wav,I JUST KNOW THAT THE TRADITION IS ALWAYS RIGHT
sample-002235.wav,THAT BAKER HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT COMPLETING THE THOUGHT
sample-002236.wav,BUT THE KING OF SALEM HOPED DESPERATELY THAT THE BOY WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL
sample-002237.wav,HE CALLED TO THE BOY AND THEY TOOK A WALK ALONG THE DUNES SURROUNDING THE ENCAMPMENT
sample-002238.wav,I LEARNED THE ALCHEMIST'S SECRETS IN MY TRAVELS
sample-002239.wav,THE STRANGER CONTINUED TO HOLD THE SWORD AT THE BOY'S FOREHEAD
sample-002240.wav,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
sample-002241.wav,BUT HE DECIDED FIRST TO BUY HIS BAKERY AND PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE
sample-002242.wav,IF I COULD I'D WRITE A HUGE ENCYCLOPEDIA JUST ABOUT THE WORDS LUCK AND COINCIDENCE
sample-002243.wav,WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
sample-002244.wav,HE ALSO TRIED TO REMEMBER SOME GOOD STORIES TO RELATE AS HE SHEARED THE SHEEP
sample-002245.wav,ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sample-002246.wav,FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
sample-002247.wav,AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sample-002248.wav,MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sample-002249.wav,I WANT TO LIVE AGAIN
sample-002250.wav,THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
sample-002251.wav,THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
sample-002252.wav,WHAT DO I DO IN SALEM THE OLD MAN LAUGHED
sample-002253.wav,IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sample-002254.wav,THIS WEDGE PREVENTS THE TRAILER FROM ROLLING DOWN THE SLOPE IN CASE OF BRAKE FAILURE
sample-002255.wav,WHO IS THIS STRANGER WHO SPEAKS OF OMENS ASKED ONE OF THE CHIEFTAINS EYEING THE BOY
sample-002256.wav,BETTER GET A PENCIL OUT AND WRITE IT DOWN
sample-002257.wav,THE HORSE GALLOPED UNCONTROLLABLY
sample-002258.wav,ISN'T IT JUST BEAUTIFUL
sample-002259.wav,YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
sample-002260.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER THOUGH SEEMED NOT TO BE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE THREAT OF WAR
sample-002261.wav,WE MUST GET SOME OF THAT SERUM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
sample-002262.wav,NO MORE TICKETS LEFT
sample-002263.wav,I'LL BE A MONKEY'S UNCLE
sample-002264.wav,WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
sample-002265.wav,UNFORTUNATELY NOBODY CAN WARRANT THE SANCTIONS THAT WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE COMMUNITY
sample-002266.wav,NEVER MIND THE EUROPEAN WAR
sample-002267.wav,IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
sample-002268.wav,OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sample-002269.wav,BUT HE HAD TO MOVE ON
sample-002270.wav,THE SUN THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND DECIDED TO SHINE MORE BRIGHTLY
sample-002271.wav,MIND IF I SIT DOWN
sample-002272.wav,THAT'S TRUE THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-002273.wav,THIS MAN LOOKED EXACTLY THE SAME EXCEPT THAT NOW THE ROLES WERE REVERSED
sample-002274.wav,BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sample-002275.wav,ARTISANAL GIN BAR SERIOUSLY
sample-002276.wav,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-002277.wav,YOU MUSTN'T LET WHAT SHE SAID BOTHER YOU
sample-002278.wav,THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
sample-002279.wav,WE MISS YOU AND MISS HAVING A FRIEND LIKE YOU AND I AM SO HAPPY THAT YOU TWO GOT TO CATCH UP
sample-002280.wav,ONCE AGAIN HE WAS EXPERIENCING THE LANGUAGE WITHOUT WORDS
sample-002281.wav,TO REALIZE ONE'S DESTINY IS A PERSON'S ONLY REAL OBLIGATION
sample-002282.wav,MAYBE WE'D BETTER ASK SOMEONE THE BOY SUGGESTED
sample-002283.wav,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sample-002284.wav,I LOCKED EYES WITH A FISH IN THE TANK
sample-002285.wav,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sample-002286.wav,THE OMENS HAD BEEN TRUE AFTER ALL
sample-002287.wav,YOU WEREN'T HERE TO BUILD THEM
sample-002288.wav,IT WAS HIS HEART THAT WOULD TELL HIM WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS HIDDEN
sample-002289.wav,YOU SHOULD READ THE NEW BOOK MARK TWAIN'S WRITING NOW
sample-002290.wav,THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER
sample-002291.wav,HE HAD USED THE TWO STONES ONLY ONCE ONE MORNING WHEN HE WAS AT A MARKETPLACE
sample-002292.wav,THE ONE YOU'RE BLOCKING
sample-002293.wav,THE GODS SHOULD NOT HAVE DESIRES BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE DESTINIES
sample-002294.wav,I FEEL LIKE A BOOTLEGGER
sample-002295.wav,THERE'S NO DANGER THE BOY SAID WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON PAST THE ENCAMPMENT
sample-002296.wav,YOUR MOTHER AND I TALKED IT OVER HALF THE NIGHT
sample-002297.wav,IMAGE REGISTRATION AND INVARIANT REPRESENTATIONS COULD BOTH BE DONE IN A COMPUTATIONALLY VERY EFFICIENT WAY
sample-002298.wav,BUT SHE SAID NOTHING
sample-002299.wav,FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
sample-002300.wav,HE CAN'T HURT ANYBODY
sample-002301.wav,THE BOY ACCUSTOMED TO RECOGNIZING OMENS SPOKE TO THE MERCHANT
sample-002302.wav,YOU'LL BE THE COUNSELOR OF THE OASIS
sample-002303.wav,YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
sample-002304.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sample-002305.wav,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sample-002306.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN SAID NOTHING
sample-002307.wav,THE FALCON'S BEAK CARRIES BITS OF ME MYSELF THE DESERT SAID
sample-002308.wav,SOMETIMES I APPEAR IN THE FORM OF A SOLUTION OR A GOOD IDEA
sample-002309.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
sample-002310.wav,I PROMISED THAT I WOULD MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
sample-002311.wav,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sample-002312.wav,I FIND THE OTHER ARGUMENT DUBIOUS
sample-002313.wav,PEERTOPEER NETWORKS ARE MORE ROBUST THAN CLIENTSERVER ARCHITECTURES
sample-002314.wav,IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID 'EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
sample-002315.wav,COME IN AGAIN SOME TIME
sample-002316.wav,THEY BEGAN TO RIDE OUT OVER THE SANDS WITH THE MOON LIGHTING THEIR WAY
sample-002317.wav,THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sample-002318.wav,AN ARMY IS COMING THE BOY SAID
sample-002319.wav,THE OLD MAN WORE A BREASTPLATE OF GOLD AND HE KNEW ABOUT MY PAST
sample-002320.wav,THEN SHE AGAIN TOOK HIS HANDS AND STUDIED THEM CAREFULLY
sample-002321.wav,I IMAGINE THIS WILL BE A SURPRISE TO SOME PEOPLE
sample-002322.wav,SUDDENLY THE ELDER AT THE CENTER SMILED ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY AND THE BOY FELT BETTER
sample-002323.wav,BUT BAKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERDS
sample-002324.wav,DON'T SIT THERE LIKE A FROZEN ROBIN
sample-002325.wav,HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sample-002326.wav,JOSHUA REGRETTED BUYING A CHEAP AIR CONDITIONER NOW THAT IT WAS WARMER
sample-002327.wav,THE NEXT DAY HE GAVE HIS SON A POUCH THAT HELD THREE ANCIENT SPANISH GOLD COINS
sample-002328.wav,I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
sample-002329.wav,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sample-002330.wav,HIS HEART WAS HEAVY AND HE HAD BEEN MELANCHOLY SINCE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
sample-002331.wav,BUT HE KNEW THAT SALEM WASN'T IN ANDALUSIA
sample-002332.wav,IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
sample-002333.wav,THE ALCHEMIST WAS A BIT DAUNTING BUT AS THE BOY DRANK THE WINE HE RELAXED
sample-002334.wav,AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE WOMAN HE LOVED
sample-002335.wav,I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
sample-002336.wav,TO NOURISH THE FALCON
sample-002337.wav,THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sample-002338.wav,THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES
sample-002339.wav,I'D LIKE TO BUILD A DISPLAY CASE FOR THE CRYSTAL THE BOY SAID TO THE MERCHANT
sample-002340.wav,IN A WAY SO AM I HE SAID
sample-002341.wav,SHE TOLD ME SHE FEELS HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC
sample-002342.wav,THE WOMAN WAS SILENT FOR SOME TIME
sample-002343.wav,HE SPENT THE ENTIRE MORNING OBSERVING THE INFREQUENT COMINGS AND GOINGS IN THE STREET
sample-002344.wav,LEANNE JOINED A CHOIR SO EVERYONE COULD HEAR HER SUBLIME SINGING VOICE
sample-002345.wav,I DON'T WANT TO RUSH YOU
sample-002346.wav,IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL
sample-002347.wav,WORRYINGLY THE RADIO SIGNAL BECAME WEAKER
sample-002348.wav,HAPPY TO KNOW YOU
sample-002349.wav,THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sample-002350.wav,THE DESERT TAKES OUR MEN FROM US AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS RETURN SHE SAID
sample-002351.wav,WORKED HARD JUST TO HAVE FOOD AND WATER LIKE THE SHEEP
sample-002352.wav,I'M GOING TO TAKE OVER A LOT OF PLATES AND THINGS
sample-002353.wav,I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS
sample-002354.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-002355.wav,SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO READ
sample-002356.wav,I'M INTERESTED ONLY IN THE PRESENT
sample-002357.wav,GOODBYE SAID THE BOY
sample-002358.wav,I WAITED ALL AFTERNOON AND EVENING HE SAID
sample-002359.wav,THE MEN WERE TERRIFIED AT HIS SORCERY
sample-002360.wav,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sample-002361.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN VANISHED TOO GONE TO FIND THE ALCHEMIST
sample-002362.wav,THE BOY AWOKE AS THE SUN ROSE
sample-002363.wav,BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sample-002364.wav,AND THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WELL
sample-002365.wav,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
sample-002366.wav,HE FORGETS THE OFFICE WHEN HE'S WITH ME
sample-002367.wav,I WOULD HAVE WON THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS IF NOT FOR THOSE MEDALING KIDS
sample-002368.wav,'EVERYONE LOVED THEM AND ENJOYED THEM
sample-002369.wav,THE BOY WAITED AND THEN INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN JUST AS HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED
sample-002370.wav,AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
sample-002371.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
sample-002372.wav,I CAN LEARN SOMETHING FROM THE DESERT TOO
sample-002373.wav,THE MONK WAS IRRITATED
sample-002374.wav,I WANTED THEM TO BE A PART OF YOUR INHERITANCE
sample-002375.wav,I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID
sample-002376.wav,WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
sample-002377.wav,HE BEGAN TO DIG AT THE BASE OF THE SYCAMORE
sample-002378.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sample-002379.wav,IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sample-002380.wav,THERE'S ONE THAT SAYS 'EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ONCE CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
sample-002381.wav,MAYBE SHE DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM
sample-002382.wav,THE MERCHANT LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE BOY
sample-002383.wav,THEN LIKE A COLONY OF WORKER ANTS THEY DISMANTLED THEIR STALLS AND LEFT
sample-002384.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
sample-002385.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING
sample-002386.wav,HE HAD BEEN SO FAR AWAY THAT HIS FACE WASN'T EVEN VISIBLE
sample-002387.wav,AND YOU OUGHT TO READ MORE ABOUT THE WORLD ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-002388.wav,THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
sample-002389.wav,THERE AIN'T ANY MORE
sample-002390.wav,HE DELETED FIVE TABLES FROM THE DATABASE
sample-002391.wav,THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS
sample-002392.wav,I WAS RIGHT THERE AND SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES
sample-002393.wav,YOU'RE DEMANDING YOUR RIGHTS
sample-002394.wav,THE MERCHANT LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE BOY
sample-002395.wav,A GREAT HUMANITARIAN AND THE BEST FRIEND THE JESSIE BAKERS HAVE
sample-002396.wav,BUT THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE A PART OF YOUR FUTURE THE SEER HAD SAID
sample-002397.wav,THE BOY TRUSTED HIS NEW FRIEND
sample-002398.wav,DID YOU ACTUALLY GIVE TAMARA THAT GUN
sample-002399.wav,YOUR HEART IS ALIVE
sample-002400.wav,THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FALLING STAR
sample-002401.wav,SHOW ME SOME GRATITUDE
sample-002402.wav,BUT THE BOY SAT DOWN AND WAITED
sample-002403.wav,BUT THIS PAYMENT GOES WELL BEYOND MY GENEROSITY THE MONK RESPONDED
sample-002404.wav,THEN THE OLD MAN BEGAN TO INSPECT THE SHEEP AND HE SAW THAT ONE WAS LAME
sample-002405.wav,THE SECRET IS HERE IN THE PRESENT
sample-002406.wav,THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
sample-002407.wav,AND WHAT DO YOU DO IN SALEM HE INSISTED
sample-002408.wav,BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
sample-002409.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
sample-002410.wav,LET'S THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-002411.wav,YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MAY DIE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sample-002412.wav,IT WAS AS IF CARL REALISED THAT HE WAS A PUPPET UNDER SOMEONE ELSE'S CONTROL
sample-002413.wav,IT SORT OF MAKES A FELLOW LOSE FAITH IN HIMSELF
sample-002414.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
sample-002415.wav,WHICH ONE ARE YOU

sample-002419.wav,THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
sample-002420.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-002421.wav,LIKE EATING OR SLEEPING OR LIKE SEEKING LOVE OR FINDING A JOB
sample-002422.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
sample-002423.wav,I FOUND MYSELF ALONE AND SAW THE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PIT RUNNING AWAY
sample-002424.wav,THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT A PERSON'S DESTINY WAS

sample-002432.wav,WE'LL HAVE SOME LUNCH AND YOU CAN TELL ME EVERYTHING
sample-002433.wav,SOMETHING BRIGHT REFLECTED FROM HIS CHEST WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT THE BOY WAS MOMENTARILY BLINDED

sample-002435.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sample-002436.wav,WITHOUT RESPONDING THE GUARD ENTERED THE TENT WHERE HE REMAINED FOR SOME TIME
sample-002437.wav,MICHAEL OPENED A BROWSER AND NAVIGATED TO AN ANONYMOUS SEARCH ENGINE

sample-002476.wav,SHE PLACED THE GLASS CAREFULLY ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE
sample-002477.wav,AND MAYBE IT WASN'T THAT THEY WERE TEACHING ME BUT THAT I WAS LEARNING FROM THEM
sample-002478.wav,YOU HAVE BEEN A REAL BLESSING TO ME

sample-002535.wav,HE COULD ALWAYS BECOME A CRYSTAL SALESMAN AGAIN
sample-002536.wav,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sample-002537.wav,YOU'LL MARRY FATIMA AND YOU'LL BOTH BE HAPPY FOR A YEAR
sample-002538.wav,I GUESS I'M NOT QUITE THE FOOTBALL TYPE

sample-002548.wav,I WAITED ALL AFTERNOON AND EVENING HE SAID
sample-002549.wav,CARBON MONOXIDE IS A VERY DANGEROUS GAS
sample-002550.wav,I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
sample-002551.wav,HIS TSHIRT WAS DRENCHED IN SWEAT
sample-002552.wav,ONLY CHRIS COULDN'T WAIT QUITE AS LONG AS THE OTHERS
sample-002553.wav,HOW DOES ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER START
sample-002554.wav,WHEN YOU PLAY CARDS THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO WIN
sample-002555.wav,AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
sample-002556.wav,THE WOMAN WAS SILENT FOR SOME TIME
sample-002557.wav,HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DODGES AND TRICKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS
sample-002558.wav,AND IN THAT MOOD HE WAS GRATEFUL TO BE IN LOVE
sample-002559.wav,TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sample-002560.wav,HE BROUGHT SIX SHEEP WITH HIM
sample-002561.wav,NOW I'M BEGINNING WHAT I COULD HAVE STARTED TEN YEARS AGO
sample-002562.wav,IT HELPED ME TO TRUST IN PEOPLE THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED
sample-002563.wav,WE WANT SOME ACTION IN THESE PICTURES
sample-002564.wav,YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
sample-002565.wav,IF YOU CAN CONCENTRATE ALWAYS ON THE PRESENT YOU'LL BE A HAPPY MAN
sample-002566.wav,HE'LL BE READY ON TIME
sample-002567.wav,HOW THEY MANAGED TO IMPROVISE AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE SHE'LL NEVER KNOW
sample-002568.wav,ONE AFTERNOON THEY PASSED BY THE ENCAMPMENT OF ONE OF THE TRIBES
sample-002569.wav,THERE'S NOBODY ELSE ON THE PAPER WHO CAN WRITE
sample-002570.wav,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sample-002571.wav,EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY THE SAME HAND
sample-002572.wav,YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY MY FATHER WAS NO BUSINESS MAN
sample-002573.wav,THE BOY SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
sample-002574.wav,THE MONEY IS UNIMPORTANT
sample-002575.wav,BUT ONLY SPEAK A WORD AND MY SERVANT WILL BE HEALED
sample-002576.wav,ONE IS LOVED BECAUSE ONE IS LOVED
sample-002577.wav,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sample-002578.wav,NOT ONLY DID HE MANAGE TO DO IT HE DID IT PROFESSIONALLY
sample-002579.wav,THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
sample-002580.wav,HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
sample-002581.wav,I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
sample-002582.wav,AS THEY WATCHED THE WAVES CRASHING INTO EACH OTHER ALICE THOUGHT OF HOME
sample-002583.wav,NOW LEAVE US ALONE SAID THE BOY TO THE YOUNG ARAB
sample-002584.wav,NONE OF WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING MADE MUCH SENSE TO THE BOY
sample-002585.wav,TWO YEARS AGO RIGHT HERE ON THIS SPOT I HAD A RECURRENT DREAM TOO
sample-002586.wav,YOU WOULDN'T MIND LIVING IN THE NICEST HOUSE IN TOWN
sample-002587.wav,WELL USUALLY I LEARN MORE FROM MY SHEEP THAN FROM BOOKS HE ANSWERED
sample-002588.wav,CAN I HELP YOU ASKED THE MAN BEHIND THE WINDOW
sample-002589.wav,I'M GOING INTO BUSINESS FOR MYSELF
sample-002590.wav,THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER
sample-002591.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sample-002592.wav,ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sample-002593.wav,WE'RE HAVING HAMBURGERS
sample-002594.wav,IT WAS SPRAYED IN RED WITH YELLOW EDGES
sample-002595.wav,THE AUTHORS CLAIM TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS VARIATIONS DUE TO GEOMETRIC TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE ACQUIRED IMAGES
sample-002596.wav,THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sample-002597.wav,HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
sample-002598.wav,HE DIDN'T WANT TO CRY WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE
sample-002599.wav,LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
sample-002600.wav,BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
sample-002601.wav,YOU ARE ALMOST AT THE END OF YOUR JOURNEY SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-002602.wav,AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sample-002603.wav,JUST ONE THING MORE
sample-002604.wav,THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
sample-002605.wav,BUT ONE OF THEM SEIZED THE BOY AND YANKED HIM BACK OUT OF THE HOLE
sample-002606.wav,THEY'D NEVER LET YOU GO
sample-002607.wav,YOU DOMINATED THOSE HORSEMEN WITH THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT THEM HE SAID
sample-002608.wav,YOU'VE PLAYED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
sample-002609.wav,FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
sample-002610.wav,THE BOY WENT TO THE WELL EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH FATIMA
sample-002611.wav,WELL THEN WHY DID YOU LET ME DO IT THE BOY ASKED
sample-002612.wav,OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
sample-002613.wav,THE BOY REPEATED HIS QUESTION
sample-002614.wav,HE ROSE AND MADE HIS WAY BACK TOWARD THE PALM TREES
sample-002615.wav,TELL HER I ELECTED HER AND I CAN HAVE HER IMPEACHED
sample-002616.wav,OR A MAN INTO THE WIND
sample-002617.wav,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
sample-002618.wav,THE ALCHEMIST'S WORDS ECHOED OUT LIKE A CURSE
sample-002619.wav,EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY THE SAME HAND
sample-002620.wav,STOP TREATING ME LIKE A CHILD
sample-002621.wav,EVERY TIME HE SAW HER HE FELT NERVOUS
sample-002622.wav,AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
sample-002623.wav,HE WAS TWENTY MINUTES FROM HIS TENT AND BEGAN TO MAKE HIS WAY THERE
sample-002624.wav,YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
sample-002625.wav,IT REALLY OUGHT TO BE EASY EXCEPT THAT RIGHT NOW THERE'S AN OUTSTANDING BUG
sample-002626.wav,TEACHING KIDS ENGLISH WITH COMMON VOICE IS A WINWIN SITUATION
sample-002627.wav,IT WAS MORE ACTIVITY THAN USUAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE MORNING
sample-002628.wav,I HAVE KNOWN TRUE ALCHEMISTS THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED
sample-002629.wav,THE TERM JUST MY TWO CENTS IS ABOUT OPINION NOT ABOUT MONEY
sample-002630.wav,CAN I GET A WOOT WOOT
sample-002631.wav,AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
sample-002632.wav,CLOSE SHOT OF THE COLONEL
sample-002633.wav,HE DIDN'T WANT TO CRY WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE
sample-002634.wav,HE COULD SEE THAT THE OLD MAN WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIS LIFE
sample-002635.wav,HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
sample-002636.wav,THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
sample-002637.wav,I HEARD WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER DAY WITH THE ALCHEMIST THE WIND SAID
sample-002638.wav,MAYBE THAT'S WHY THEY CAME
sample-002639.wav,THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
sample-002640.wav,I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE
sample-002641.wav,DEE'S HOUSE RIGHT NOW
sample-002642.wav,EARLIER THIS YEAR WE FOUND A REALLY NICE PLACE NEAR MY OFFICE AND WE MOVED IN TOGETHER
sample-002643.wav,BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
sample-002644.wav,IS THERE NO SENSE OF HONOR LEFT IN THIS COUNTRY
sample-002645.wav,SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO HOLD BACK THE RIVER
sample-002646.wav,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
sample-002647.wav,HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
sample-002648.wav,BUT WE'VE ALL GOT TO GET IN THERE AND PLAY
sample-002649.wav,THERE MIGHT BE SECRET MESSAGES IN THIS TEXT
sample-002650.wav,I FIND THAT THE BEST WAY TO COMBAT THIS ISSUE IS TO USE THE BUILTIN VOCABULARY EDITOR
sample-002651.wav,HE WATCHED THE HAWKS AS THEY DRIFTED ON THE WIND
sample-002652.wav,SOME OF OUR BIGGEST CLIENTS ARE AFFECTED
sample-002653.wav,THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS KNAPSACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANK SOME
sample-002654.wav,I'M LEAVING TODAY SAID THE BOY
sample-002655.wav,SAY SOMETHING ELSE
sample-002656.wav,BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sample-002657.wav,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
sample-002658.wav,HE WAS TWENTY MINUTES FROM HIS TENT AND BEGAN TO MAKE HIS WAY THERE
sample-002659.wav,I CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-002660.wav,THE WOMEN TOOK TURNS BUILDING A TALL STABLE PILE OF ROCKS
sample-002661.wav,THEN WHOSE IS IT
sample-002662.wav,MAYBE BECAUSE THAT WASN'T REALLY HIS DREAM
sample-002663.wav,BUT I NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT
sample-002664.wav,THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
sample-002665.wav,BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST YOUR SAVINGS TWICE
sample-002666.wav,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sample-002667.wav,CAME TO THE BAR HE HAD ENTERED ON HIS FIRST DAY THERE
sample-002668.wav,AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE WOMAN HE LOVED
sample-002669.wav,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sample-002670.wav,YOU HAVE NO CAR
sample-002671.wav,WE COULDN'T MAKE IT IN A WEEK
sample-002672.wav,THE FIVE FRENCH TOURISTS STEPPED OVER THE EXCITED BULLDOGS
sample-002673.wav,YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE LEFT
sample-002674.wav,HAVING HEARD THAT THE BOY BECAME EVEN MORE INTERESTED IN ALCHEMY
sample-002675.wav,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sample-002676.wav,DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID
sample-002677.wav,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
sample-002678.wav,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sample-002679.wav,THERE ARE MANY LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY THINGS THE BOY SAID
sample-002680.wav,THERE WAS A GENERAL MOVEMENT BACKWARDS
sample-002681.wav,I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
sample-002682.wav,THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP
sample-002683.wav,THEY EAT LUNCH TOGETHER OFTEN BUT DONT REALLY TALK OUTSIDE THE OFFICE
sample-002684.wav,I'VE ALREADY HAD THAT EXPERIENCE WITH MY SHEEP AND NOW IT'S HAPPENING WITH PEOPLE
sample-002685.wav,BUT I'M NOT THROUGH COMPLAINING YET
sample-002686.wav,IT IS STILL A PHENOMENAL MOVEMENT
sample-002687.wav,IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS THAT HE COVERED IN AN HOUR
sample-002688.wav,I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE
sample-002689.wav,THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
sample-002690.wav,I TOLD HIM THAT WAS WHAT I HAD COME HERE TO LEARN
sample-002691.wav,THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
sample-002692.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sample-002693.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-002694.wav,I HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT THE SULFUR
sample-002695.wav,HE HAD STUDIED LATIN SPANISH AND THEOLOGY
sample-002696.wav,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sample-002697.wav,HE FELT WEIGHTED DOWN BY THE CENTURIES OF TIME SINCE THE PYRAMIDS HAD BEEN BUILT
sample-002698.wav,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
sample-002699.wav,BUT THE MERCHANT UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY HAD SAID
sample-002700.wav,I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE IN A WAY
sample-002701.wav,IT'S PAST YOUR BEDTIME
sample-002702.wav,YEAH BETTER IF PEOPLE ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH ONE AND ARE THINKING OF SWITCHING TO THE OTHER
sample-002703.wav,HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT AND THE NIGHT AFTER
sample-002704.wav,WHAT'LL I TELL HIM
sample-002705.wav,I'M AN OLD SUPERSTITIOUS ARAB AND I BELIEVE IN OUR PROVERBS
sample-002706.wav,HE WAS THINKING ABOUT OMENS AND SOMEONE HAD APPEARED
sample-002707.wav,SEVERAL FIGURES APPROACHED HIM
sample-002708.wav,IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND
sample-002709.wav,I GUESS I WAS HOMESICK
sample-002710.wav,THEN YOU TAUGHT ME SOMETHING OF THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AND THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
sample-002711.wav,HIS HEART WAS HEAVY AND HE HAD BEEN MELANCHOLY SINCE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
sample-002712.wav,WHAT DAY IS IT
sample-002713.wav,AN ALCHEMIST SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-002714.wav,AND FOR WISE MEN GOLD IS THE METAL THAT EVOLVED THE FURTHEST
sample-002715.wav,THE BOY WAS GETTING IRRITATED
sample-002716.wav,I AIN'T GONNA SQUEAL
sample-002717.wav,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
sample-002718.wav,IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
sample-002719.wav,I AM PROUD OF YOU HE SAID
sample-002720.wav,WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE THEN
sample-002721.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN DIDN'T ANSWER HIM DIRECTLY
sample-002722.wav,YEAH I LIKE THAT
sample-002723.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sample-002724.wav,THE WIND BEGAN TO BLOW AGAIN
sample-002725.wav,THEY WENT TO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY
sample-002726.wav,THE INSURGENTS GATHERED STICKS AND WOOD
sample-002727.wav,SUDDENLY FOR NO APPARENT REASON THE BOY'S HORSE BEGAN TO SLOW
sample-002728.wav,ONE AFTERNOON ONE OF HIS SERVANTS FELL ILL AND IT APPEARED THAT HE WOULD DIE
sample-002729.wav,HIS FATHER SAID NO MORE
sample-002730.wav,FIRST THEY TRIED TO FIND HIM ON THEIR OWN
sample-002731.wav,OUR MORTGAGE IS IN ARREARS
sample-002732.wav,HIS INTERNET CONNECTION WAS TOO SLOW
sample-002733.wav,THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY
sample-002734.wav,THE ANGEL TOUCHED THE MAN'S SHOULDER AND THEY WERE BOTH PROJECTED FAR INTO THE FUTURE
sample-002735.wav,TRAVELING ALONE IS GOOD FOR MEETING NEW PEOPLE
sample-002736.wav,AND BETTER STILL TO BE ALONE WITH ONE'S BOOKS
sample-002737.wav,HENDERSON WAS TAKING IT IN
sample-002738.wav,HE BROUGHT SIX SHEEP WITH HIM
sample-002739.wav,BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sample-002740.wav,BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE A GREEN FIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME
sample-002741.wav,THIS BANANA TASTES LIKE CHERRIES
sample-002742.wav,HOW LONG IS IT
sample-002743.wav,THE STEEL OF ITS BLADE GLITTERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
sample-002744.wav,AND THE SOLID PART WAS CALLED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
sample-002745.wav,THE STRANGER WITHDREW THE SWORD FROM THE BOY'S FOREHEAD AND THE BOY FELT IMMENSELY RELIEVED
sample-002746.wav,THE OMENS HAD BEEN TRUE AFTER ALL
sample-002747.wav,GIVE ME MY ROBE
sample-002748.wav,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
sample-002749.wav,DO YOU MIND IF I SIT DOWN
sample-002750.wav,ALCHEMY IS A SERIOUS DISCIPLINE
sample-002751.wav,WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THEM
sample-002752.wav,YOU CERTAINLY DELIVERED THE GOODS
sample-002753.wav,HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO GET ANY WORK DONE
sample-002754.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sample-002755.wav,AND FIND OUT WHERE THE NEAREST TELEGRAPH OFFICE IS
sample-002756.wav,MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sample-002757.wav,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
sample-002758.wav,THEY'RE NOT CONCERNED WITH THAT RIGHT NOW
sample-002759.wav,THEY REMINDED HIM OF THE OLD MAN
sample-002760.wav,THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sample-002761.wav,AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS
sample-002762.wav,THAT'S ABOUT THE BEST DESCRIPTION I KNOW
sample-002763.wav,WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sample-002764.wav,MAYONNAISE IS MADE FROM EGGS OIL VINEGAR AND MUSTARD
sample-002765.wav,CAROL SAVED HER BROTHER'S LIFE THAT DAY
sample-002766.wav,HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
sample-002767.wav,MEN DREAM MORE ABOUT COMING HOME THAN ABOUT LEAVING THE BOY SAID
sample-002768.wav,DID YOU EVER WALK INTO THIS OFFICE
sample-002769.wav,YOU HIT MY BEST FRIEND
sample-002770.wav,NOW I'M BEGINNING WHAT I COULD HAVE STARTED TEN YEARS AGO
sample-002771.wav,THE BOY WENT TO THE WELL EVERY DAY TO MEET WITH FATIMA
sample-002772.wav,WE CAN'T LEAVE GREG HERE
sample-002773.wav,I CAN HELP HIM
sample-002774.wav,HAVE YOU GOT THE SPEECH I GAVE YOU
sample-002775.wav,SHE'S JUST ABOUT TO CLOSE UP THE LIBRARY
sample-002776.wav,ON THE THIRD DAY THE CHIEF MET WITH HIS OFFICERS
sample-002777.wav,AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
sample-002778.wav,DIY PROJECTS CAN HELP YOU SAVE MONEY AND TAILOR THINGS TO YOUR NEEDS
sample-002779.wav,WHAT HAD BEEN NEXT TO HIM FIVE MINUTES AGO WAS NOW AT THE OTHER SIDE
sample-002780.wav,THIS IS FOR YOU
sample-002781.wav,YOU HAVE A MANIA FOR SIMPLIFYING EVERYTHING ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN IRRITATED
sample-002782.wav,TO KEEP ON PITCHING
sample-002783.wav,THEY BLOW ACROSS THE WORLD WITHOUT A BIRTHPLACE AND WITH NO PLACE TO DIE
sample-002784.wav,IT'S A NASTY DAY
sample-002785.wav,THE SHEPHERD SWORE THAT HE WOULD
sample-002786.wav,HE IS GOING TO TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE WIND JUST TO DEMONSTRATE HIS POWERS
sample-002787.wav,YOU CAN'T OFFER ME SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY MINE THE CHIEF SAID ARROGANTLY
sample-002788.wav,WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
sample-002789.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
sample-002790.wav,THE DESERT FILLS MEN'S HEARTS WITH VISIONS THE CAMEL DRIVER ANSWERED
sample-002791.wav,I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
sample-002792.wav,I NEVER SAW AMANDA ACT LIKE THAT BEFORE
sample-002793.wav,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
sample-002794.wav,SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
sample-002795.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
sample-002796.wav,THE HORIZON WAS TINGED WITH RED AND SUDDENLY THE SUN APPEARED
sample-002797.wav,THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
sample-002798.wav,THERE'S A BUNCH OF AUTOGRAPH SEEKERS OUT FRONT
sample-002799.wav,NEVER MIND THOSE GUYS
sample-002800.wav,THE BOY THOUGHT OF FATIMA
sample-002801.wav,BUT BEFORE I GO I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY
sample-002802.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
sample-002803.wav,ONCE TO THE THIEF AND ONCE TO THE GENERAL
sample-002804.wav,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
sample-002805.wav,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
sample-002806.wav,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
sample-002807.wav,THERE WAS NO EXCUSE FOR GOODMAN TO FLY OFF THE HANDLE
sample-002808.wav,I'M INTERESTED ONLY IN THE PRESENT
sample-002809.wav,AT NIGHT THEY SPREAD THEIR SLEEPING GEAR AND KEPT THEIR FIRES HIDDEN
sample-002810.wav,THE OMENS HAD TOLD HIM SO
sample-002811.wav,THE ONLY THINGS THAT CONCERNED THE SHEEP WERE FOOD AND WATER
sample-002812.wav,THE ALCHEMIST'S WORDS ECHOED OUT LIKE A CURSE
sample-002813.wav,YOU MUST ALWAYS KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sample-002814.wav,HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sample-002815.wav,IT'S NOT MY HOUSE
sample-002816.wav,THE GENIES WERE THE SPIRITS OF GOOD AND EVIL
sample-002817.wav,ARE YOU IN THE BOOK
sample-002818.wav,IT ALMOST GIVES HIM A FEELING HE WASN'T WANTED
sample-002819.wav,IT KNEW OF THE BOY'S TALK WITH THE DESERT BECAUSE THE WINDS KNOW EVERYTHING
sample-002820.wav,EVERYBODY QUIET AND READY FOR AN EMERGENCY
sample-002821.wav,THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WE WILL BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR OUR ENEMIES
sample-002822.wav,CAN I GO NOW
sample-002823.wav,WHAT IS IT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ASKED THE OLD MERCHANT
sample-002824.wav,HE KNEW ALL THE FIELDS AND PASTURES OF ANDALUSIA
sample-002825.wav,HE FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE AWOKE THE SUN WAS ALREADY HIGH
sample-002826.wav,HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
sample-002827.wav,IT KNEW OF THE BOY'S TALK WITH THE DESERT BECAUSE THE WINDS KNOW EVERYTHING
sample-002828.wav,IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
sample-002829.wav,IT'S NOT WHAT ENTERS MEN'S MOUTHS THAT'S EVIL SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-002830.wav,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY BEGINNER'S LUCK
sample-002831.wav,SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sample-002832.wav,THE BOY THOUGHT IT A STRANGE QUESTION
sample-002833.wav,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
sample-002834.wav,YOU GOT YOUR WATERMELON
sample-002835.wav,MISTER KRISTEN HAS SOMETHING TO SAY TO US
sample-002836.wav,I LOST MY WALLET
sample-002837.wav,WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
sample-002838.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
sample-002839.wav,AND IN THAT MOOD HE WAS GRATEFUL TO BE IN LOVE
sample-002840.wav,HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A STONE THAT ROLLED UP TO THE MINER'S FOOT
sample-002841.wav,AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY
sample-002842.wav,THEY WALKED TOGETHER THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS OF TANGIER
sample-002843.wav,THERE WAS A GENERAL MOVEMENT BACKWARDS
sample-002844.wav,WHEN I TRIED IT ABOUT A YEAR AGO IT DIDN'T WORK NEARLY AS WELL AS USING IT ON MY LOCAL MACHINE
sample-002845.wav,THE EMERALD TABLET IS A DIRECT PASSAGE TO THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
sample-002846.wav,HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE
sample-002847.wav,HE CARRIED TWO DEAD HAWKS OVER HIS SHOULDER
sample-002848.wav,AS THEY MOVED ALONG THE BOY TRIED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART
sample-002849.wav,WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
sample-002850.wav,WHENEVER HE SAW THE SEA OR A FIRE HE FELL SILENT IMPRESSED BY THEIR ELEMENTAL FORCE
sample-002851.wav,THERE WAS SURELY A BAKER IN HER TOWN
sample-002852.wav,SHE HAD HER CARDIGAN ON
sample-002853.wav,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sample-002854.wav,SEND THOSE OTHER PEOPLE IN
sample-002855.wav,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sample-002856.wav,THE BOY AND THE ENGLISHMAN HAD BOUGHT CAMELS AND CLIMBED UNCERTAINLY ONTO THEIR BACKS
sample-002857.wav,WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO REPORT
sample-002858.wav,SHE MAY BE LOST
sample-002859.wav,ANY TIME BUT CHRISTMAS
sample-002860.wav,BETTER BRING ME A GLASS OF MILK
sample-002861.wav,WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST LOOK AT HIS FEET
sample-002862.wav,THE LEVANTER INCREASED IN INTENSITY
sample-002863.wav,MANY PEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE SURREY AND MIDDLESEX MUST HAVE SEEN IT
sample-002864.wav,YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
sample-002865.wav,HE DIDN'T WANT HIS HAND TO BEGIN TREMBLING SHOWING THE OLD WOMAN THAT HE WAS FEARFUL
sample-002866.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
sample-002867.wav,THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
sample-002868.wav,THAT ISN'T WHAT I GOT MARRIED FOR
sample-002869.wav,AND HE IMMEDIATELY FELT PEACE IN HIS HEART
sample-002870.wav,WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL FOR YOU
sample-002871.wav,SHE CAN'T GET AWAY
sample-002872.wav,NOT EVERYONE CAN SEE HIS DREAMS COME TRUE IN THE SAME WAY
sample-002873.wav,HE LISTENED TO THE WIND AND FELT THE STONES BENEATH HIS FEET

sample-002991.wav,FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
sample-002992.wav,FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR
sample-002993.wav,THEY LOCKED THEMSELVES IN THEIR LABORATORIES AND TRIED TO EVOLVE AS GOLD HAD

sample-003001.wav,THE BRAKE FLUID WAS LEAKING OUT ONTO THE PATH
sample-003002.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH

sample-003014.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
sample-003015.wav,TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
sample-003016.wav,LOOKING AROUND HE SOUGHT HIS SHEEP AND THEN REALIZED THAT HE WAS IN A NEW WORLD
sample-003017.wav,I'M A WOMAN OF THE DESERT SHE SAID AVERTING HER FACE
sample-003018.wav,A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sample-003019.wav,WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE THINGS MAKE EVEN MORE SENSE HE THOUGHT
sample-003020.wav,YOU DON'T CALL THIS A CONVENIENCE
sample-003021.wav,THEY ALSO BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THEY KNEW A BETTER WAY THAN OTHERS HAD
sample-003022.wav,BUT I LIKE IT THAT WAY
sample-003023.wav,IT WAS ONLY WORDS
sample-003024.wav,THE INTERNET SHOULD REFLECT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO USE IT
sample-003025.wav,IT WAS OUR MONEY AND WE WANT IT BACK

sample-003030.wav,HE WALKED SLOWLY THROUGH THE MARKET
sample-003031.wav,MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sample-003032.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
sample-003033.wav,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-003034.wav,ONE MINUTE TO GO
sample-003035.wav,HE WAS TWENTY MINUTES FROM HIS TENT AND BEGAN TO MAKE HIS WAY THERE
sample-003036.wav,BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO REALIZE YOUR DESTINY
sample-003037.wav,BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
sample-003038.wav,I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES
sample-003039.wav,ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS TALK TO HIM
sample-003040.wav,THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING

sample-003043.wav,ITS IMPORTANT TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND SHE HAS URGED ME TO DO THE SAME
sample-003044.wav,IT'S TRUE THAT EVERYTHING HAS ITS DESTINY BUT ONE DAY THAT DESTINY WILL BE REALIZED
sample-003045.wav,OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
sample-003046.wav,BUT HE KEPT THE SWORD IN HIS HAND
sample-003047.wav,BECAUSE I DON'T LOVE HIM
sample-003048.wav,YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE

sample-003518.wav,THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
sample-003519.wav,YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
sample-003520.wav,HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK WILL BE THERE
sample-003521.wav,COME ON WITH THAT MONEY
sample-003522.wav,THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
sample-003523.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
sample-003524.wav,IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sample-003525.wav,I WANTED THEM TO BE A PART OF YOUR INHERITANCE
sample-003526.wav,I'M STILL HAVING TROUBLE WITH BAKING
sample-003527.wav,THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS

sample-003534.wav,HE RESTARTED HIS EFFORTS FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME
sample-003535.wav,DON'T LISTEN TO THAT
sample-003536.wav,HE RAN HIS FINGERS SLOWLY OVER THE STONES SENSING THEIR TEMPERATURE AND FEELING THEIR SURFACES
sample-003537.wav,YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
sample-003538.wav,GYPSIES ARE EXPERTS AT GETTING PEOPLE TO DO THAT SIGHED THE OLD MAN
sample-003539.wav,BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL HERE
sample-003540.wav,AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS
sample-003541.wav,THE FACT THAT THE TWO HOURS HAD STRETCHED INTO AN ENTIRE YEAR DIDN'T MATTER
sample-003542.wav,MAYBE NO ONE HERE KNOWS WHAT AN ALCHEMIST IS
sample-003543.wav,DIVERS FOUND A DEAD PERSON IN THE LAKE
sample-003544.wav,THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sample-003545.wav,HERE'S TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS
sample-003546.wav,BUT BAKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERDS
sample-003547.wav,MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
sample-003548.wav,THEY'RE FORMING CLUBS
sample-003549.wav,BUT THEY COULD NEVER HAVE TAUGHT HIM ARABIC

sample-003551.wav,WHERE'S ASHLEY'S WALLET
sample-003552.wav,THEY'RE STARTING TO THROW THINGS

sample-003557.wav,THEY BOTH SPOKE THE SAME LANGUAGE
sample-003558.wav,WHY DIDN'T I CALL YOU BACK
sample-003559.wav,I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
sample-003560.wav,HE HAD FOUND WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS AND WAS FRIGHTENED AT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
sample-003561.wav,YOU GOT YOUR SEA LEGS YET
sample-003562.wav,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sample-003563.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sample-003564.wav,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
sample-003565.wav,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
sample-003566.wav,THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED WELLS FIFTY THOUSAND DATE TREES AND INNUMERABLE COLORED TENTS SPREAD AMONG THEM
sample-003567.wav,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sample-003568.wav,THE ALCHEMIST TURNED TO THE BOY
sample-003569.wav,BUT THIS PAYMENT GOES WELL BEYOND MY GENEROSITY THE MONK RESPONDED
sample-003570.wav,SUDDENLY THE MONSTER DISAPPEARED
sample-003571.wav,A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
sample-003572.wav,I HAVE THE MONEY I NEED TO BUY MY SHEEP
sample-003573.wav,HE BECAME FRIENDLY WITH THE CAMEL DRIVER WHO TRAVELED ALONGSIDE HIM
sample-003574.wav,SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
sample-003575.wav,WHO TOLD YOU THAT ASKED THE BOY STARTLED
sample-003576.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-003577.wav,LISTEN TO THAT MOB
sample-003578.wav,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sample-003579.wav,THE FOOL FLEW ALL THE WAY UP HERE IN A BLIZZARD
sample-003580.wav,GO ON OUT AND GET RID OF IT
sample-003581.wav,I'LL HAVE NED WRITE IT UP

sample-003583.wav,THE IRISH MAN SIPPED HIS TEA
sample-003584.wav,I'M AFRAID THAT IF MY DREAM IS REALIZED I'LL HAVE NO REASON TO GO ON LIVING
sample-003585.wav,EXPERTS OF GEOLOGY AGREE YESTERDAY'S TSUNAMI WAS JUST A HERALD OF THE IMMINENT APOCALYPSE
sample-003586.wav,WHENEVER HE COULD HE SOUGHT OUT A NEW ROAD TO TRAVEL
sample-003587.wav,AT THIS HOUR OF THE MORNING
sample-003588.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES

sample-003595.wav,CASPER PREDICTED THE OUTCOME
sample-003596.wav,THE BOY REMINDED THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HIDDEN TREASURE
sample-003597.wav,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sample-003598.wav,AND YOUR CAMELS WILL BRING YOU WEALTH AND POWER
sample-003599.wav,IT WAS BETTER THAN THE SCENT OF THE HOOKAHS
sample-003600.wav,TOMORROW SELL YOUR CAMEL AND BUY A HORSE
sample-003601.wav,OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sample-003602.wav,I'M GOING HOME AND SEE MY WIFE AND FAMILY

sample-003606.wav,THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-003607.wav,THE ONE IN THERE
sample-003608.wav,HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
sample-003609.wav,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
sample-003610.wav,THEY WENT ON SMOKING THE PIPE FOR A WHILE AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SET
sample-003611.wav,THE BATTLES MAY LAST FOR A LONG TIME PERHAPS EVEN YEARS
sample-003612.wav,IT WAS A A KIND OF FASCINATION THAT PARALYSED MY ACTIONS
sample-003613.wav,THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
sample-003614.wav,LET US IN ON IT
sample-003615.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
sample-003616.wav,THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE MAN'S CLOTHING WAS STRANGE
sample-003617.wav,I'VE BEEN TO YOUR HOUSE A HUNDRED TIMES
sample-003618.wav,THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
sample-003619.wav,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sample-003620.wav,IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
sample-003621.wav,CURSE THE MOMENT I MET THAT OLD MAN HE THOUGHT
sample-003622.wav,IT'S ALL RIGHT IF YOU WANT TO SMOKE YOUR CIGAR NOW
sample-003623.wav,THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
sample-003624.wav,WHAT'S SHE UP TO
sample-003625.wav,WHAT DID YOU STOP IT FOR
sample-003626.wav,HE TOLD HER ABOUT THE MORNING'S MEETING
sample-003627.wav,DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE DONE
sample-003628.wav,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sample-003629.wav,MARK UNTAPED THE PACKAGE CAREFULLY
sample-003630.wav,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sample-003631.wav,HE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AND WAS SURE THAT SHE HAD PROBABLY MARRIED
sample-003632.wav,I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS
sample-003633.wav,I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
sample-003634.wav,THE BOY WAS SHOCKED
sample-003635.wav,IT SPOKE OF JOURNEYS DISCOVERIES BOOKS AND CHANGE
sample-003636.wav,THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sample-003637.wav,THE NAVY'S GOING TO FLY FATHER HOME THIS AFTERNOON
sample-003638.wav,I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sample-003639.wav,IT'S TRUE THAT EVERYTHING HAS ITS DESTINY BUT ONE DAY THAT DESTINY WILL BE REALIZED
sample-003640.wav,THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
sample-003641.wav,AND THE SOLID PART WAS CALLED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
sample-003642.wav,I'M NOT WORKING FOR ANY OTHER PAPER
sample-003643.wav,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
sample-003644.wav,AND IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT LOVE
sample-003645.wav,BESIDES THAT THERE WAS A HEAP OF BICYCLES
sample-003646.wav,I HAVE A TAXI WAITING DOWNSTAIRS
sample-003647.wav,YOU'RE JUST LIKE FATHER USED TO BE

sample-003652.wav,BUT HE DECIDED FIRST TO BUY HIS BAKERY AND PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE
sample-003653.wav,IT'S THE EMERALD TABLET SAID THE ENGLISHMAN PROUD THAT HE MIGHT TEACH SOMETHING TO THE BOY
sample-003654.wav,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sample-003655.wav,SO HIS HEART WAS QUIET FOR AN ENTIRE AFTERNOON
sample-003656.wav,THE BOY AND THE ENGLISHMAN HAD BOUGHT CAMELS AND CLIMBED UNCERTAINLY ONTO THEIR BACKS
sample-003657.wav,SOMETIMES I APPEAR IN THE FORM OF A SOLUTION OR A GOOD IDEA
sample-003658.wav,I CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-003659.wav,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sample-003660.wav,SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP
sample-003661.wav,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sample-003662.wav,ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
sample-003663.wav,THE BOY SAW A MAN APPEAR BEHIND THE COUNTER
sample-003664.wav,THE BOY COULD CERTAINLY RESIST CAUSING THAT KIND OF ANXIETY FOR THE BAKER
sample-003665.wav,HER FATHER'S AWFUL WORRIED ABOUT HER
sample-003666.wav,YOU SHOULD EVALUATE IT IN A PERCEPTUAL EXPERIMENT
sample-003667.wav,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
sample-003668.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN VANISHED TOO GONE TO FIND THE ALCHEMIST
sample-003669.wav,MANY OF OUR SOLDIERS TEAMED UP
sample-003670.wav,SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHT SAY IT TRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND
sample-003671.wav,'EVERYONE LOVED THEM AND ENJOYED THEM
sample-003672.wav,THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT

sample-003674.wav,WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
sample-003675.wav,IT WAS A TENT LIKE MANY AT THE OASIS
sample-003676.wav,HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS
sample-003677.wav,DID YOU INVITE HIM TO THE CONCERT
sample-003678.wav,HE AROSE AND TAKING UP HIS CROOK BEGAN TO AWAKEN THE SHEEP THAT STILL SLEPT
sample-003679.wav,THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
sample-003680.wav,THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH A THICK PASTE
sample-003681.wav,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sample-003682.wav,WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT OMENS THE BOY'S INTEREST WAS INCREASING BY THE MOMENT
sample-003683.wav,YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
sample-003684.wav,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS

sample-003693.wav,LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
sample-003694.wav,IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW
sample-003695.wav,FOR THE BEST PART OF ITS LIFE THE TABLE HAS BEEN STANDING IN THE BASEMENT
sample-003696.wav,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
sample-003697.wav,WHAT ABOUT THIS JOB
sample-003698.wav,THE BOY BECAME FEARFUL THE OMENS TOLD HIM THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG
sample-003699.wav,THEY WERE HIS TREASURE

sample-003707.wav,WAIT FOR THE END OF THE WAR
sample-003708.wav,THE MEN CLIMBED THE HILL AND THEY WERE TIRED WHEN THEY REACHED THE TOP

sample-003717.wav,WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
sample-003718.wav,DOESN'T THAT MAKE SENSE
sample-003719.wav,GIVEN ONLY THE PUBLIC KEY IT IS VERY HARD TO COMPUTE THE PRIVATE ONE

sample-003739.wav,THE ALCHEMIST DISMOUNTED AND TOLD THE ESCORTS THEY COULD RETURN TO THE CAMP
sample-003740.wav,YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
sample-003741.wav,WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT OMENS THE BOY'S INTEREST WAS INCREASING BY THE MOMENT
