sample-000008.wav,THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sample-000009.wav,THE TEACHER THOUGHT THAT HE'D TAUGHT HIMSELF ALL HE COULD

sample-000046.wav,WE MUST BE GOOD
sample-000047.wav,HE ALMOST BEGAN TO TELL ABOUT HIS TREASURE BUT DECIDED NOT TO DO SO
sample-000048.wav,NOT EVEN THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS ARE ABLE TO SEE HIM WHEN THEY WANT TO
sample-000049.wav,WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
sample-000050.wav,THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
sample-000051.wav,OUR GENERATOR HAS BEEN DISRUPTED BY ULTRA HIGH FREQUENCY WAVES
sample-000052.wav,HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
sample-000053.wav,ALMOST EVERYONE HERE SPEAKS SPANISH
sample-000054.wav,THE REPORT WAS LARGELY SCATHING
sample-000055.wav,NO ONE ATTACKS AN OASIS
sample-000056.wav,WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
sample-000057.wav,BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sample-000058.wav,IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER

sample-000075.wav,JUDGE DEBRA SENT ME
sample-000076.wav,A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sample-000077.wav,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sample-000078.wav,THE HOMELESS SEEM TO LIKE SOUP
sample-000079.wav,AND FINALLY THE FALCON RETURNED WITH THEIR MEAL
sample-000080.wav,TWO MORE MONTHS PASSED AND THE SHELF BROUGHT MANY CUSTOMERS INTO THE CRYSTAL SHOP
sample-000081.wav,HE DECANTED THE WINE AND BEGAN TO RECOUNT THE DISTURBING STORY HE HAD BEEN TOLD
sample-000082.wav,AT LEAST SHE KNOWS HOW TO BEHAVE AT FUNERALS
sample-000083.wav,LOOK AT THE POLICY I GAVE HIM
sample-000084.wav,THEN I DON'T GET PAID
sample-000085.wav,I GOT TWO GIANT BUG BITES ON MY RIGHT LEG FROM LAST NIGHT AND THEY HURT
sample-000086.wav,BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
sample-000087.wav,AND ALSO BY UNHAPPINESS ENVY AND JEALOUSY
sample-000088.wav,SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
sample-000089.wav,THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER
sample-000090.wav,I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CHARGE THEM WITH
sample-000091.wav,WHAT WAS ALL THAT
sample-000092.wav,IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD DONE THAT
sample-000093.wav,IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sample-000094.wav,WE CAN'T LET THE CHRONICLE GET THE LAUGH ON US
sample-000095.wav,YOU'RE FAR TOO VALUABLE
sample-000096.wav,THEY EAT LUNCH TOGETHER OFTEN BUT DONT REALLY TALK OUTSIDE THE OFFICE

sample-000104.wav,I'LL HANG IT UP
sample-000105.wav,THERE IS A WAY OUT
sample-000106.wav,I'M GOING WITH YOU THE BOY SAID
sample-000107.wav,WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
sample-000108.wav,I'LL TELL YOU IN A MINUTE
sample-000109.wav,I THINK THEY PERCEIVED THAT NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE AT THE MOMENT
sample-000110.wav,IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
sample-000111.wav,THAT'S WHY I WAS SENT DOWN HERE
sample-000112.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sample-000113.wav,HE HAD COME TO THE TOWN ONLY TO FIND A WOMAN WHO COULD INTERPRET HIS DREAM
sample-000114.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
sample-000115.wav,FOR SOME REASON WE WERE BLOCKED FROM ENTERING
sample-000116.wav,THE SWIMMING POOL WAS FULL OF CHLORINE
sample-000117.wav,BUT YOU ARE IN THE DESERT
sample-000118.wav,HE WAS MORE CONFIDENT IN HIMSELF THOUGH AND FELT AS THOUGH HE COULD CONQUER THE WORLD
sample-000119.wav,SHE REFILLED HER VESSEL AND LEFT
sample-000120.wav,I NOTICED THAT THE BOY ANSWERED
sample-000121.wav,THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WE WILL BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR OUR ENEMIES
sample-000122.wav,AT OTHER TIMES AT A CRUCIAL MOMENT I MAKE IT EASIER FOR THINGS TO HAPPEN
sample-000123.wav,ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
sample-000124.wav,YOU CAN'T DESERT NOW
sample-000125.wav,I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
sample-000126.wav,YOU HAVE BEEN STOPPING ME
sample-000127.wav,THERE WERE RAISED VOICESAND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON 
sample-000128.wav,I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
sample-000129.wav,HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS
sample-000130.wav,USING SCRIPT BLOCKERS IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA BUT IT REQUIRES THE USER TO LEARN A BIT
sample-000131.wav,SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
sample-000132.wav,HE'S HOME COOKING DINNER
sample-000133.wav,LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE STANDARD DEVIATION
sample-000134.wav,NOW THAT'S TOO MUCH
sample-000135.wav,HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sample-000136.wav,THE CEILING COLLAPSED INWARDS
sample-000137.wav,FOR EXAMPLE I CAN SAY SCORE TEST WORD TO PRINT TEST WORD OR CAMEL TEST WORD TO PRINT TESTWORD
sample-000138.wav,I'M A WOMAN OF THE DESERT SHE SAID AVERTING HER FACE
sample-000139.wav,WE WANT TO SELL HANDMADE CHUKKA BOOTS IN THAT FOOD TRUCK
sample-000140.wav,HE'S TALKING LIKE A CHILD
sample-000141.wav,THE QUICKER THE BETTER
sample-000142.wav,AND YOU MARRIED HER
sample-000143.wav,FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
sample-000144.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN'S EYES LIT UP
sample-000145.wav,FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
sample-000146.wav,WHEN THE SUN SETS THE MEN WILL ONCE AGAIN SURRENDER THEIR ARMS TO ME
sample-000147.wav,ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
sample-000148.wav,BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sample-000149.wav,NOW LEAVE US ALONE SAID THE BOY TO THE YOUNG ARAB
sample-000150.wav,ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS
sample-000151.wav,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sample-000152.wav,I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING THE BOY ANSWERED
sample-000153.wav,A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
sample-000154.wav,I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED

sample-000161.wav,THE MAN LOOKED AT THE ANGEL IN SURPRISE
sample-000162.wav,HE ONLY LOST THREE BUTTONS OFF HIS VEST
sample-000163.wav,I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER AFTER THE BOAT SAILS
sample-000164.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN DIDN'T ANSWER HIM DIRECTLY
sample-000165.wav,HE FELT WEIGHTED DOWN BY THE CENTURIES OF TIME SINCE THE PYRAMIDS HAD BEEN BUILT
sample-000166.wav,FATIMA THE GIRL SAID AVERTING HER EYES
sample-000167.wav,THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
sample-000168.wav,IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE
sample-000169.wav,I'M NOT RUBBING IT IN
sample-000170.wav,NOW LET'S SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU PROTEST
sample-000171.wav,FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
sample-000172.wav,ON THE VERY FIRST PAGE IT DESCRIBED A BURIAL CEREMONY
sample-000173.wav,YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOU SAY MY FATHER WAS NO BUSINESS MAN
sample-000174.wav,THE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A PERSON AND HURRIED AWAY
sample-000175.wav,WHAT BOAT YOU SAILING ON

sample-000180.wav,WHAT A LOAD OF TRASH SARAH OPINED
sample-000181.wav,REST WELL TONIGHT AS IF YOU WERE A WARRIOR PREPARING FOR COMBAT
sample-000182.wav,THE TEENAGERS PUT ON RED HOODIES FOR THEIR ANNUAL TOBOGGAN RUN
sample-000183.wav,LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sample-000184.wav,BERLIN CAN BE SO LOVELY THIS TIME OF YEAR
sample-000185.wav,LAURA TOOK OUT A CIGARETTE AND PLACED IT IN HER MOUTH
sample-000186.wav,THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT HIS DESTINY TO THE END
sample-000187.wav,THE VISION VANISHED IMMEDIATELY BUT IT HAD SHAKEN HIM
sample-000188.wav,ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sample-000189.wav,CROOKS DON'T PAY TAXES
sample-000190.wav,THE OMENS HAD TOLD HIM SO
sample-000191.wav,BUT THE BOY KNEW THAT HE WAS REFERRING TO FATIMA
sample-000192.wav,THE ARAB ACCEPTED THEM WITHOUT A WORD
sample-000193.wav,BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sample-000194.wav,WELCOME TO DAVE'S GUITAR SESSION
sample-000195.wav,IS THAT JOB STILL OPEN
sample-000196.wav,WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT MAN WANTED TO TRAVEL TOO
sample-000197.wav,HE BELIEVED IN OMENS
sample-000198.wav,ON TOP OF ALL THAT THE WEEDS KEEP GROWING AND THE GARBAGE HAS TO BE TAKEN OUT
sample-000199.wav,BUT A LOVELY CHAP
sample-000200.wav,AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
sample-000201.wav,THAT'S NOT SO BAD
sample-000202.wav,HOW STRANGE AFRICA IS THOUGHT THE BOY
sample-000203.wav,HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
sample-000204.wav,FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
sample-000205.wav,AND EVENTUALLY MAN WILL NOURISH YOUR SANDS WHERE THE GAME WILL ONCE AGAIN FLOURISH
sample-000206.wav,THE ALCHEMISTS SPENT YEARS IN THEIR LABORATORIES OBSERVING THE FIRE THAT PURIFIED THE METALS
sample-000207.wav,WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT
sample-000208.wav,ANY DECENT EDITOR CAN SHOW YOU LINE NUMBERS AND LET YOU JUMP TO A SPECIFIC LINE
sample-000209.wav,I'M GOING INTO THE DESERT THE MAN ANSWERED TURNING BACK TO HIS READING
sample-000210.wav,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sample-000211.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT
sample-000212.wav,MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
sample-000213.wav,I WANT MY GARDEN TO BE FILLED WITH ROSES PETUNIAS AND PASSION FLOWERS
sample-000214.wav,AND WE HAD A BITE
sample-000215.wav,MR AND MRS NATE JOINED THE RED CROSS AND SEWED
sample-000216.wav,THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WE WILL BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR OUR ENEMIES
sample-000217.wav,JUST AS YOUR GRANDFATHER TAUGHT YOU
sample-000218.wav,THE MODEL HAS EFFECTIVELY THREE FULLY CONNECTED LAYERS
sample-000219.wav,HE SAW THAT FATIMA'S EYES WERE FILLED WITH TEARS
sample-000220.wav,TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sample-000221.wav,THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sample-000222.wav,AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS
sample-000223.wav,AS HE LOOKED AT THE STONES HE FELT RELIEVED FOR SOME REASON
sample-000224.wav,IT WAS VERY HARD FOR HER TO FOCUS
sample-000225.wav,DURING THE THIRD YEAR THE OMENS WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK OF YOUR TREASURE AND YOUR DESTINY
sample-000226.wav,THE WIND HAS MANY NAMES
sample-000227.wav,I PROMISED THAT I WOULD MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
sample-000228.wav,THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF HET DESERT
sample-000229.wav,MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE
sample-000230.wav,THE SHOP IS CLOSED ON MONDAYS
sample-000231.wav,HE FELT UNEASY AT THE MAN'S PRESENCE
sample-000232.wav,LET'S HAVE YOUR STORY
sample-000233.wav,IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
sample-000234.wav,ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS
sample-000235.wav,THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
sample-000236.wav,IF YOU STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT RECURSION IS READ THIS SENTENCE AGAIN
sample-000237.wav,THE THIEF WASN'T THERE AND THE OWNER BROUGHT HIM A CUP OF TEA
sample-000238.wav,THEY ARE SO USED TO ME THAT THEY KNOW MY SCHEDULE HE MUTTERED
sample-000239.wav,THE MONK WAS IRRITATED
sample-000240.wav,A SHEPHERD MAY LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT HE SHOULD NEVER FORGET ABOUT HIS SHEEP
sample-000241.wav,IT'S PRACTICALLY UP THERE NOW
sample-000242.wav,AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
sample-000243.wav,CAME TO THE BAR HE HAD ENTERED ON HIS FIRST DAY THERE
sample-000244.wav,THE BOY TRIED TO READ WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE SAND
sample-000245.wav,I READ ONLY WHAT THE BIRDS WANTED TO TELL ME
sample-000246.wav,HE STUCK HIS HAND INTO THE POUCH AND FELT AROUND FOR ONE OF THE STONES
sample-000247.wav,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
sample-000248.wav,AN IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS THE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCES THAT IS TO SAY INPUTS
sample-000249.wav,YOU HAVE A MANIA FOR SIMPLIFYING EVERYTHING ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN IRRITATED
sample-000250.wav,WHERE SHE USED TO LIVE
sample-000251.wav,AT ONCE HE CONNECTED THE TWO INCIDENTS
sample-000252.wav,WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT MAN WANTED TO TRAVEL TOO
sample-000253.wav,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
sample-000254.wav,I HAVE ALREADY FOUND MY TREASURE
sample-000255.wav,THE BOY WAS BECOMING NERVOUS
sample-000256.wav,WHO IS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIEF ASKED
sample-000257.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
sample-000258.wav,BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sample-000259.wav,MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sample-000260.wav,THEY PLAY DUETS TOGETHER
sample-000261.wav,HE DIDN'T KNOW THE MAN YET BUT HIS PRACTICED EYE WOULD RECOGNIZE HIM WHEN HE APPEARED
sample-000262.wav,I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
sample-000263.wav,SHE NEEDS TO GET HER TRANSCRIPTS AND PASSPORT FIRST
sample-000264.wav,WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK AND EAT THESE HAWKS

sample-000267.wav,YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
sample-000268.wav,HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sample-000269.wav,THE OLD MAN WORE A BREASTPLATE OF GOLD AND HE KNEW ABOUT MY PAST
sample-000270.wav,ANOTHER TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-000271.wav,THE FIRST BASEMAN DROPPED THE BALL
sample-000272.wav,HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRAMIDS WERE
sample-000273.wav,THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE OWNER OF THE BAR STOOD NEARBY LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO THEIR CONVERSATION
sample-000274.wav,IS IT FOR FURTHER AUTOMATIC PROCESSING
sample-000275.wav,ONCE TO THE THIEF AND ONCE TO THE GENERAL
sample-000276.wav,FROM THEN ON THE BOY UNDERSTOOD HIS HEART
sample-000277.wav,OF COURSE HE'S COMING BACK HERE
sample-000278.wav,THEY'RE JUST A PILE OF STONES
sample-000279.wav,I READ ONLY WHAT THE BIRDS WANTED TO TELL ME
sample-000280.wav,THEN WHO ARE YOU
sample-000281.wav,THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sample-000282.wav,THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED WELLS FIFTY THOUSAND DATE TREES AND INNUMERABLE COLORED TENTS SPREAD AMONG THEM
sample-000283.wav,I'LL BET YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THOSE
sample-000284.wav,THE PEAK OF THIS MOUNTAIN IS OVER TWO THOUSAND METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL
sample-000285.wav,THE BOY WATCHED THE EXCHANGE WITH FASCINATION
sample-000286.wav,IT REQUIRED NO EXPLANATION JUST AS THE UNIVERSE NEEDS NONE AS IT TRAVELS THROUGH ENDLESS TIME
sample-000287.wav,I WON'T SAY ANYTHING
sample-000288.wav,I ALWAYS HAVE BOTH
sample-000289.wav,HE DIDN'T WANT TO CRY WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE
sample-000290.wav,LISTEN TO YOUR HEART
sample-000291.wav,I'M DYING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE
sample-000292.wav,THE TEA SEEMED LESS BITTER
sample-000293.wav,OUR CLOTHES ARE DRY
sample-000294.wav,THAT'S THE PRINCIPLE THAT GOVERNS ALL THINGS HE SAID
sample-000295.wav,THE INVADERS CARRIED THE NAME EVERYWHERE THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL SPOKE OF THE INVADERS WITH PRIDE
sample-000296.wav,THEY WERE RELIEVED AND HAPPY
sample-000297.wav,A PART OF ME IS ALSO TRYING TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO TRAVEL AS MUCH ANYMORE
sample-000298.wav,WHAT DID I TELL YOU
sample-000299.wav,SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sample-000300.wav,HE TRIED AGAIN TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PINK SHADES OF THE DESERT AND ITS STONES
sample-000301.wav,A MONK DRESSED IN BLACK CAME TO THE GATES
sample-000302.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sample-000303.wav,THE BOY NOTICED THAT THE MAN'S CLOTHING WAS STRANGE
sample-000304.wav,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sample-000305.wav,THE HULL OF THE SHIP COLLAPSED
sample-000306.wav,SOMEBODY HAD RETURNED MY LOST CREDIT CARD TO THE BANK
sample-000307.wav,ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS TALK TO HIM

sample-000309.wav,I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
sample-000310.wav,AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sample-000311.wav,WHAT'S THIS THE END OF THE EIGHTH
sample-000312.wav,AND THERE WERE DUNES ROCKS AND PLANTS THAT INSISTED ON LIVING WHERE SURVIVAL SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
sample-000313.wav,BECAUSE YOU'LL KNOW ITS DREAMS AND WISHES AND WILL KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM
sample-000314.wav,I HAVE DISABLED SOME OF THE CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES BUT THEY'RE NOT GRAYED OUT IN THIS LIST

sample-000316.wav,YOU TOLD ME THAT
sample-000317.wav,I'M GOING TO MISS ANNIE
sample-000318.wav,HE PUT HIS HEADCLOTH IN PLACE AND SECURED IT WITH A RING MADE OF CAMEL SKIN
sample-000319.wav,AND YOUR CAMELS WILL BRING YOU WEALTH AND POWER
sample-000320.wav,WE'RE HAVING HAMBURGERS
sample-000321.wav,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
sample-000322.wav,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES

sample-000324.wav,MOIST SOIL IS GOOD FOR THE FLORA
sample-000325.wav,I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS YOUR DATASET AND THAT IT IS NEW
sample-000326.wav,NOBODY'S GOING TO RUSH ME INTO ANYTHING
sample-000327.wav,I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
sample-000328.wav,SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVOLVED
sample-000329.wav,JUST WHAT IS THE LOWDOWN ON WILLIAMS
sample-000330.wav,IT'S NOT WHAT ENTERS MEN'S MOUTHS THAT'S EVIL SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-000331.wav,THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES

sample-000333.wav,WHAT DOES THAT GET US
sample-000334.wav,THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sample-000335.wav,LOVE REQUIRED THEM TO STAY WITH THE PEOPLE THEY LOVED
sample-000336.wav,ONE NIGHT THE FATHER HAD A DREAM
sample-000337.wav,IT DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING
sample-000338.wav,I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS ONE UP
sample-000339.wav,HE'S DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO
sample-000340.wav,LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
sample-000341.wav,SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO HOLD BACK THE RIVER
sample-000342.wav,THERE'LL BE NO RED UPRISING
sample-000343.wav,HER HEIGHT HELPED HER WITH HER FIGHTING
sample-000344.wav,BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHEAR FOUR SHEEP
sample-000345.wav,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
sample-000346.wav,THEN SUDDENLY THEY KNEEL AND DIE
sample-000347.wav,GOATS ALWAYS HAVE A BETTER VIEW

sample-000366.wav,SHE LIKES YOU WELL ENOUGH TO STICK AROUND

sample-000394.wav,YOU CAN ONLY SPIT OUT SO MANY SEEDS
sample-000395.wav,THERE'S NO DANGER THE BOY SAID WHEN THEY HAD MOVED ON PAST THE ENCAMPMENT
sample-000396.wav,THAT'S THE MAIN IDEA
sample-000397.wav,SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVOLVED
sample-000398.wav,THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sample-000399.wav,I HAVEN'T ANY WATCH
sample-000400.wav,THE FOREST BURNED FOR THIRTEEN DAYS

sample-000408.wav,HE WANDERED FOR A WHILE KEEPING THE DATE PALMS OF THE OASIS WITHIN SIGHT
sample-000409.wav,HE'S WATCHING THE OTHER DOOR
sample-000410.wav,AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP

sample-000416.wav,SHE PROBABLY WORKED IT OUT IN ADVANCE
sample-000417.wav,WHEN HE'S AN OLD MAN HE'S GOING TO SPEND A MONTH IN AFRICA
sample-000418.wav,THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sample-000419.wav,THE REST OF YOU GET IN HERE AND RIOT
sample-000420.wav,I WANT MY HUSBAND TO WANDER AS FREE AS THE WIND THAT SHAPES THE DUNES
sample-000421.wav,SHE'S ACCUSED OF STEALING A WATCH
sample-000422.wav,DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
sample-000423.wav,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sample-000424.wav,A GHOSTLY FIGURE APPEARED
sample-000425.wav,WHAT'S THE GOOD OF ARGUING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T EXIST

sample-000427.wav,BUT SHE IS GONE
sample-000428.wav,I'VE CROSSED THESE SANDS MANY TIMES SAID ONE OF THE CAMEL DRIVERS ONE NIGHT
sample-000429.wav,WITHOUT RESPONDING THE GUARD ENTERED THE TENT WHERE HE REMAINED FOR SOME TIME
sample-000430.wav,I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE
sample-000431.wav,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sample-000432.wav,HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A STONE THAT ROLLED UP TO THE MINER'S FOOT
sample-000433.wav,THE DAY WAS HOT AND THE WINE WAS REFRESHING
sample-000434.wav,THE HAND WITH THE WHIP POINTED TO THE SOUTH
sample-000435.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-000436.wav,I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD CREATE A CONCISE TABLE
sample-000437.wav,AND ALSO BECAUSE I KNOW ABOUT THE SOUL OF THE WORLD HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
sample-000438.wav,DON'T YOU PUSH ME AROUND LIKE THAT
sample-000439.wav,THE BOY FELT A PANG IN HIS HEART THINKING ABOUT THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
sample-000440.wav,I'M GOING TO FIND THAT DAMNED ALCHEMIST THE ENGLISHMAN THOUGHT
sample-000441.wav,THEY WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GOLD HIS COMPANION ANSWERED
sample-000442.wav,THE BOY REMEMBERED AN OLD PROVERB FROM HIS COUNTRY
sample-000443.wav,WE MUST BE GOOD
sample-000444.wav,YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE THAT HAS ALL THE ANSWERS
sample-000445.wav,AND THE ODOR OF THE ANIMALS BECAME A BIT MORE TOLERABLE
sample-000446.wav,HE REALLY WAS A KING A WISE KING
sample-000447.wav,THE HIGH HUMIDITY IS MAKING ME SWEAT
sample-000448.wav,IT'S USUALLY CUSTOMARY TO BRING THE MONEY WITH YOU
sample-000449.wav,I IMAGINE THIS WILL BE A SURPRISE TO SOME PEOPLE
sample-000450.wav,WE'D BETTER FORGET IT
sample-000451.wav,THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID THE SAME THING
sample-000452.wav,MEN DREAM MORE ABOUT COMING HOME THAN ABOUT LEAVING THE BOY SAID

sample-000456.wav,THIS IS FOR YOU HE SAID HOLDING ONE OF THE PARTS OUT TO THE MONK
sample-000457.wav,YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
sample-000458.wav,AND I TOLD HARRY I THOUGHT I'D BE BORED TO DEATH
sample-000459.wav,IT WAS HIS HEART THAT WOULD TELL HIM WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS HIDDEN
sample-000460.wav,HOW DO YOU THINK THE TABLE LOOKS
sample-000461.wav,PUTTING A POOL UNDER THIS FLOOR WAS A GREAT IDEA

sample-000468.wav,IT'S TRUE LIFE REALLY IS GENEROUS TO THOSE WHO PURSUE THEIR DESTINY THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-000469.wav,ARE YOU GOING TO TALK OR AREN'T YOU
sample-000470.wav,HE SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY LIKE THEM
sample-000471.wav,WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE
sample-000472.wav,I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
sample-000473.wav,JIM BECAME HEAD OF THE DRAFT BOARD
sample-000474.wav,HE TOOK THE FOURTH PART AND HANDED IT TO THE MONK
sample-000475.wav,MAKTUB THOUGHT THE BOY
sample-000476.wav,EXACTLY ANSWERED THE ALCHEMIST
sample-000477.wav,A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sample-000478.wav,THE AIRPLANE ROSE GRACEFULLY INTO THE SKY
sample-000479.wav,IT'S TOO BAD THAT HE'S QUICKLY GOING TO FORGET MY NAME HE THOUGHT
sample-000480.wav,NOBODY WANTED TO DISCUSS HOW WE ALL ENDED UP TRAPPED IN A GIANT LUNCHBOX
sample-000481.wav,NATURE KNOWS ME AS THE WISEST BEING IN CREATION THE SUN SAID
sample-000482.wav,LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID
sample-000483.wav,I KNOW WHY I WANT TO GET BACK TO MY FLOCK HE THOUGHT
sample-000484.wav,AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sample-000485.wav,BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
sample-000486.wav,SHE WENT OVER TO THE HOSPITAL TO CALL ON PROFESSOR DAVIS
sample-000487.wav,HE REACHED OVER AND PICKED UP A SHELL FROM THE GROUND
sample-000488.wav,I CAN'T QUITE HEAR YOU
sample-000489.wav,MAYBE THESE DESERT BIRDS COULD EXPLAIN TO HIM THE MEANING OF LOVE WITHOUT OWNERSHIP
sample-000490.wav,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sample-000491.wav,BUT NOW THE SOUNDS INSIDE HAD STOPPED
sample-000492.wav,SEND THOSE OTHER PEOPLE IN
sample-000493.wav,THAT'S A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FROM A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE
sample-000494.wav,AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
sample-000495.wav,MAYBE WE'RE ALL THAT WAY THE BOY MUSED
sample-000496.wav,I WANT THOSE STAMPS
sample-000497.wav,HE WAS JUST AND GOOD
sample-000498.wav,WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE
sample-000499.wav,WE CAN'T LEAVE GREG HERE
sample-000500.wav,RATE A CONFLICT OF VISIONS ZERO POINTS
sample-000501.wav,THEY MADE THE BOY CONTINUE DIGGING BUT HE FOUND NOTHING
sample-000502.wav,WITHOUT THE DATASET THE ARTICLE IS USELESS
sample-000503.wav,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sample-000504.wav,DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
sample-000505.wav,THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sample-000506.wav,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sample-000507.wav,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
sample-000508.wav,I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID
sample-000509.wav,MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
sample-000510.wav,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
sample-000511.wav,YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH SKINNY POPULAR OR EVEN OWN A CAPE TO PERFORM A RANDOM ACT OF KINDNESS
sample-000512.wav,I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THIS THING
sample-000513.wav,HE WAS LEARNING A LOT OF NEW THINGS
sample-000514.wav,THE BOY TURNED TO THE HAND THAT WROTE ALL
sample-000515.wav,HOW ARE THE WEIGHTS COMPUTED
sample-000516.wav,HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS
sample-000517.wav,BUT THE KING OF SALEM HOPED DESPERATELY THAT THE BOY WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL
sample-000518.wav,THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD
sample-000519.wav,THE BOY LOOKED AROUND HIM AT THE DATE PALMS
sample-000520.wav,AND IT'S NOT LOVE TO SEE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE LIKE YOU DO
sample-000521.wav,THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY
sample-000522.wav,I WAS RIGHT THERE AND SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES
sample-000523.wav,MEANWHILE THE OLD MAN PERSISTED IN HIS ATTEMPT TO STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION

sample-000538.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-000539.wav,THE YEARS OF RESEARCH THE MAGIC SYMBOLS THE STRANGE WORDS AND THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT

sample-000551.wav,HE FELT UNSAFE LIKE DURING HIS FIRST LESSON IN DRIVING SCHOOL
sample-000552.wav,HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS
sample-000553.wav,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sample-000554.wav,WHAT ARE THESE THINGS HE ASKED
sample-000555.wav,CAME TO THE BAR HE HAD ENTERED ON HIS FIRST DAY THERE
sample-000556.wav,DO I KNOCK OR SOMETHING
sample-000557.wav,BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
sample-000558.wav,THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
sample-000559.wav,MONDAY MORNING AT FIVE O'CLOCK
sample-000560.wav,YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY BABIES AS YOU LIKE
sample-000561.wav,I'LL ALWAYS LET YOU DOWN
sample-000562.wav,THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY

sample-000564.wav,THE BASKETBALL BOUNCED OFF HIS SHIELD OF TITANIUM
sample-000565.wav,BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOVE

sample-000569.wav,THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE BOY DUG AT THE PLACE HE HAD CHOSEN BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-000570.wav,SO THEN TRY HE SAID TO THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-000571.wav,WHY DO YOU THINK I BROUGHT YOU HERE
sample-000572.wav,UNTIL MY WING WENT BAD
sample-000573.wav,ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
sample-000574.wav,DID SHE SOLVE THE RIDDLE ALL BY HERSELF
sample-000575.wav,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
sample-000576.wav,I'VE LEARNED THINGS FROM THE SHEEP AND I'VE LEARNED THINGS FROM CRYSTAL HE THOUGHT
sample-000577.wav,JUST YOU AND I
sample-000578.wav,EVEN THOUGH THE SHEEP DIDN'T TEACH ME TO SPEAK ARABIC
sample-000579.wav,HOW SHOULD I KNOW
sample-000580.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sample-000581.wav,IT MEANS ONLY THAT THE HEART DOES WHAT IT CAN THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sample-000582.wav,ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING

sample-000588.wav,HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sample-000589.wav,DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
sample-000590.wav,JUDGE DEBRA SENT ME
sample-000591.wav,A MISSING PARROT IS CALLED A POLYGON
sample-000592.wav,THE MORNING POST IS NOT OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE OR HIDING CRIMINALS
sample-000593.wav,THE WHOLE OFFICE WAS STRUCK BY A DEAFENING SILENCE
sample-000594.wav,IT'S EASY AND YET I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE HE THOUGHT
sample-000595.wav,IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
sample-000596.wav,IN ANOTHER YEAR MAYBE I CAN HELP
sample-000597.wav,SOMETIMES THEIR CARAVAN MET WITH ANOTHER
sample-000598.wav,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
sample-000599.wav,THEN SHE FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER AND LEFT
sample-000600.wav,IT WAS JUST RIPE ENOUGH TO EAT
sample-000601.wav,I'LL WORK ALL NIGHT UNTIL DAWN AND I'LL CLEAN EVERY PIECE OF CRYSTAL IN YOUR SHOP
sample-000602.wav,WALKING ALONG IN THE SILENCE HE HAD NO REGRETS
sample-000603.wav,USING SCRIPT BLOCKERS IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA BUT IT REQUIRES THE USER TO LEARN A BIT
sample-000604.wav,LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID
sample-000605.wav,THE BOY PICKED UP HIS POUCH AND PUT IT WITH HIS OTHER THINGS
sample-000606.wav,I'M THE ONE THAT KNOWS
sample-000607.wav,BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sample-000608.wav,THE WAR IS GOING TO END SOMEDAY THE GIRL SAID

sample-000610.wav,I DON'T THINK I FOLLOW YOU
sample-000611.wav,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-000612.wav,I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND
sample-000613.wav,THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
sample-000614.wav,THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH THE BOY THOUGHT RUEFULLY
sample-000615.wav,AND MAYBE IT WASN'T THAT THEY WERE TEACHING ME BUT THAT I WAS LEARNING FROM THEM
sample-000616.wav,THE HORIZON WAS TINGED WITH RED AND SUDDENLY THE SUN APPEARED
sample-000617.wav,THEY'RE NOT WORTH MUCH THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED
sample-000618.wav,WE'LL FIND YOU A HOTEL
sample-000619.wav,THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sample-000620.wav,I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD TELL ME A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE AND WORK THERE
sample-000621.wav,SHE DECIDED AGAINST IT
sample-000622.wav,MAYBE THESE DESERT BIRDS COULD EXPLAIN TO HIM THE MEANING OF LOVE WITHOUT OWNERSHIP
sample-000623.wav,I GOT DOCTOR BILLS TO PAY
sample-000624.wav,DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN ABANDONED CHURCH

sample-000628.wav,HE TOLD FATIMA THAT AT THEIR NEXT MEETING
sample-000629.wav,ALL THINGS ARE ONE
sample-000630.wav,THINK I'LL GO HOME AND SEE WHAT THE FAMILY IS DOING
sample-000631.wav,THE NEARBY CITY OF CEUTA HAD GROWN FASTER THAN TANGIER AND BUSINESS HAD FALLEN OFF
sample-000632.wav,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
sample-000633.wav,I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sample-000634.wav,I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
sample-000635.wav,MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sample-000636.wav,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sample-000637.wav,YOU'RE WORTH YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD

sample-000887.wav,HE CALLED TO THE BOY AND THEY TOOK A WALK ALONG THE DUNES SURROUNDING THE ENCAMPMENT
sample-000888.wav,IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW
sample-000889.wav,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
sample-000890.wav,THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-000891.wav,DIDN'T YOU TELL HER
sample-000892.wav,HE DIDN'T KNOW THE MAN YET BUT HIS PRACTICED EYE WOULD RECOGNIZE HIM WHEN HE APPEARED

sample-000901.wav,THAT WOMAN IS GONNA BE ON THAT ROOF
sample-000902.wav,THE FAMILIES WILL BE HERE SOON
sample-000903.wav,EVERYONE WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG KNOWS WHAT THEIR DESTINY IS
sample-000904.wav,I'M GOING TO TELL YOUR MOTHER ON YOU
sample-000905.wav,TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY

sample-000911.wav,HE NEEDED SOMEONE TO TALK TO SO AS TO AVOID THINKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF WAR
sample-000912.wav,THE NEWS WAS CHILLING TO SAY THE LEAST
sample-000913.wav,AT THAT POINT THE OMENS WILL TELL YOU THAT YOUR TREASURE IS BURIED FOREVER

sample-000923.wav,I'M NOT GOING VERY FAR THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE HORSEMEN
sample-000924.wav,I WANTED TO SLEEP A LITTLE LONGER HE THOUGHT
sample-000925.wav,IT'S A MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS NATURE AND THE WORLD
sample-000926.wav,TURNING THE AIR CONDITIONING ON LEADS TO AN INCREASED FUEL CONSUMPTION
sample-000927.wav,IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
sample-000928.wav,NOT UNTIL THE MOON WAS HIGH DID THE ALCHEMIST RIDE INTO VIEW
sample-000929.wav,THAT'S TRUE THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-000930.wav,I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
sample-000931.wav,IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT GUARANTEES EVERYONE'S FREEDOM
sample-000932.wav,I HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT TROOPS OR ABOUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRIBES
sample-000933.wav,IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
sample-000934.wav,I WOULDN'T LIVE IN IT AS A GHOST
sample-000935.wav,TELL YOUR HEART THAT THE FEAR OF SUFFERING IS WORSE THAN THE SUFFERING ITSELF
sample-000936.wav,BUT THEY'RE SOMEBODY'S CHILDREN
sample-000937.wav,AND THERE YOU WERE IN BED
sample-000938.wav,THE HYDROGEN GAS ESCAPED
sample-000939.wav,ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sample-000940.wav,THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL SEE THAT AND YOU'LL BE DISMISSED FROM YOUR POSITION AS COUNSELOR
sample-000941.wav,TOO BAD I COULDN'T SEE THIS GUY FIRST

sample-000944.wav,HE SAID HE COULDN'T HAVE HANDLED IT BETTER HIMSELF
sample-000945.wav,I WONDER WHAT'S KEEPING MOTHER
sample-000946.wav,ONE IS LOVED BECAUSE ONE IS LOVED
sample-000947.wav,THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN
sample-000948.wav,HE DECIDED TO STAY RIGHT THERE AND AWAIT HIS RETURN
sample-000949.wav,THAT'S WHY I FEEL THAT I DESERVE A PART OF WHAT YOU FIND
sample-000950.wav,AS THE SUN ROSE THE MEN BEGAN TO BEAT THE BOY
sample-000951.wav,THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sample-000952.wav,WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT
sample-000953.wav,GIVEN ONLY THE PUBLIC KEY IT IS VERY HARD TO COMPUTE THE PRIVATE ONE
sample-000954.wav,IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sample-000955.wav,WE HAVE ALSO STARTED CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING BACK TO COLORADO
sample-000956.wav,THE NEWS WAS CHILLING TO SAY THE LEAST
sample-000957.wav,AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE WOMAN HE LOVED
sample-000958.wav,SO YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE THE BOY SAID

sample-000976.wav,HE CALLED TO THE BOY AND THEY TOOK A WALK ALONG THE DUNES SURROUNDING THE ENCAMPMENT
sample-000977.wav,LIKE CRICKETS AND LIKE EXPECTATIONS LIKE LIZARDS AND FOURLEAF CLOVERS
sample-000978.wav,A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
sample-000979.wav,THE TURF AND GRAVEL AROUND IT SEEMED CHARRED AS IF BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION
sample-000980.wav,THEY SAY IT'S A FAKE
sample-000981.wav,THE BOY THOUGHT OF FATIMA
sample-000982.wav,I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY
sample-000983.wav,JUST BY LOOKING AT THEM
sample-000984.wav,LUKE I AM YOUR SISTER

sample-000993.wav,I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO TEACH ME SOME OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW
sample-000994.wav,'EVERYONE LOVED THEM AND ENJOYED THEM
sample-000995.wav,SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
sample-000996.wav,WEARING HIS NEW SANDALS HE DESCENDED THE STAIRS SILENTLY
sample-000997.wav,THESE ARE NOT CAMELS
sample-000998.wav,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sample-000999.wav,HE BEGAN TO DIG AT THE BASE OF THE SYCAMORE
sample-001000.wav,I TOLD YOU I CAN'T USE YOUR COLUMN ANY MORE
sample-001001.wav,I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
sample-001002.wav,YOU CAN GET AROUND VERY EASILY BY TRAIN  WHICH IS A VERY RELAXING AND AFFORDABLE WAY TO TRAVEL
sample-001003.wav,HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
sample-001004.wav,UPON RETURNING TO THE WISE MAN HE RELATED IN DETAIL EVERYTHING HE HAD SEEN
sample-001005.wav,YOU CAN DO A LOT JUST USING YOUR VOICE BUT THERE ARE STILL A FEW TIMES YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF REACHING FOR A MOUSE
sample-001006.wav,YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
sample-001007.wav,MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
sample-001008.wav,AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER

sample-001018.wav,THE TREASURE IS AT THE PYRAMIDS THAT YOU ALREADY KNEW
sample-001019.wav,I DON'T BLAME YOU
sample-001020.wav,CURSE THE MOMENT I MET THAT OLD MAN HE THOUGHT
sample-001021.wav,THE SOUL OF THE WORLD IS NOURISHED BY PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS
sample-001022.wav,THERE WERE RAISED VOICESAND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON 
sample-001023.wav,THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
sample-001024.wav,THE SNAKE SLITHERED TOWARD THE SHADED BOULDERS UNDER THE CLIFF
sample-001025.wav,FROM HERE ON YOU WILL BE ALONE THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sample-001026.wav,THE BOY REMEMBERED HIS DREAM AND SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR TO HIM
sample-001027.wav,IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TALKING TO HIS SHEEP
sample-001028.wav,AND HE ASKED THE BOY IF HE TOO WERE IN SEARCH OF THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001029.wav,I'LL WORK ALL NIGHT UNTIL DAWN AND I'LL CLEAN EVERY PIECE OF CRYSTAL IN YOUR SHOP
sample-001030.wav,WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TELL
sample-001031.wav,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
sample-001032.wav,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
sample-001033.wav,DON'T YOU KNOW THERE ARE NINE JOBS WAITING FOR THIS GUY
sample-001034.wav,NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN

sample-001036.wav,SANDRA READ ALOUD THE STRANGE EXCERPT
sample-001037.wav,THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COMPANY
sample-001038.wav,THE CRIMINALS TAUNTED THE POLICE OFFICERS AND PRISON GUARDS
sample-001039.wav,AND IN THAT WAY THE MONTHS PASSED
sample-001040.wav,THE BOY BEGAN AGAIN TO READ HIS BOOK BUT HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO CONCENTRATE
sample-001041.wav,CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT
sample-001042.wav,IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
sample-001043.wav,THEY WENT IN TO DRINK THE TEA WHICH WAS SERVED IN BEAUTIFUL CRYSTAL GLASSES
sample-001044.wav,ARE YOU CERTAIN IT'S NOT A MONSTER
sample-001045.wav,STARTING WITH HIS OWN
sample-001046.wav,THAT'S WHY I KEEP LOSING
sample-001047.wav,WHAT HAD BEEN NEXT TO HIM FIVE MINUTES AGO WAS NOW AT THE OTHER SIDE
sample-001048.wav,I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY
sample-001049.wav,I'LL WORK ALL NIGHT UNTIL DAWN AND I'LL CLEAN EVERY PIECE OF CRYSTAL IN YOUR SHOP
sample-001050.wav,BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GO INTO BATTLE
sample-001051.wav,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
sample-001052.wav,HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURN TO HIS MEDITATION
sample-001053.wav,THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
sample-001054.wav,THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sample-001055.wav,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sample-001056.wav,BUT THEN I REALIZED SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
sample-001057.wav,IF A PERSON IS LIVING OUT HIS DESTINY HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW
sample-001058.wav,JUST A MEMORY RIGHT NOW IT SIGNIFIED SHADE WATER AND A REFUGE FROM THE WAR
sample-001059.wav,THEY HAVE CHEAP SAUSAGES AND FRIES AT THE BREWERY TOMORROW
sample-001060.wav,THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
sample-001061.wav,MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
sample-001062.wav,THEY SEEMED TO LAUGH AT HIM AND HE LAUGHED BACK HIS HEART BURSTING WITH JOY

sample-001065.wav,YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
sample-001066.wav,I DON'T BELIEVE IT
sample-001067.wav,BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
sample-001068.wav,THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sample-001069.wav,EVIDENTLY WE'RE THE FLOOR SHOW
sample-001070.wav,IT'S NOT I THE WIND SPOKE ABOUT
sample-001071.wav,THE BOY STEPPED CLOSER TO THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SMILED HE DID THE SAME
sample-001072.wav,THE BOY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
sample-001073.wav,CAN YOU GET IN THIS DESK
sample-001074.wav,ELLIE WON FIRST PRIZE IN THE SPELLING COMPETITION
sample-001075.wav,WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
sample-001076.wav,BUT THE MERCHANT UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY HAD SAID
sample-001077.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sample-001078.wav,THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES
sample-001079.wav,ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS
sample-001080.wav,THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sample-001081.wav,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sample-001082.wav,I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL
sample-001083.wav,BUT THEY DON'T COUNT
sample-001084.wav,ONLY CHRIS COULDN'T WAIT QUITE AS LONG AS THE OTHERS
sample-001085.wav,NOW I WANT YOU TO SIGN THIS AGREEMENT
sample-001086.wav,I REALLY DID IT QUITE BRILLIANTLY
sample-001087.wav,HOLD ON A MINUTE
sample-001088.wav,SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
sample-001089.wav,WHERE DO YOU LIVE SHOUTED THE BOY AS THE HORSEMAN RODE AWAY
sample-001090.wav,AND HE ASKED THE BOY IF HE TOO WERE IN SEARCH OF THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001091.wav,HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DODGES AND TRICKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS
sample-001092.wav,YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE IN A LOVING WAY AND DIED WITH DIGNITY
sample-001093.wav,BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
sample-001094.wav,AN LED WAS INDICATING THE PROXIMITY DETECTOR WAS WORKING PROPERLY
sample-001095.wav,THAT'S WHAT KILLED HIM
sample-001096.wav,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sample-001097.wav,THERE WAS A TIME WHEN FOR ME A CAMEL'S WHINNYING WAS NOTHING MORE THAN WHINNYING
sample-001098.wav,YOU HAVE BEEN STOPPING ME
sample-001099.wav,I'M GOING TO THEM
sample-001100.wav,THE ALCHEMIST WAS A BIT DAUNTING BUT AS THE BOY DRANK THE WINE HE RELAXED
sample-001101.wav,THE STRANGER WAS SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT
sample-001102.wav,HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sample-001103.wav,WHAT'S THE WORLD'S GREATEST LIE THE BOY ASKED COMPLETELY SURPRISED
sample-001104.wav,THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PRINTING PRESS IN THOSE DAYS THE BOY ARGUED
sample-001105.wav,BUT THE MERCHANT UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY HAD SAID
sample-001106.wav,THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WE WILL BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR OUR ENEMIES
sample-001107.wav,THE OTHER SON WAS A POET AND DELIGHTED ALL OF ROME WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL VERSES
sample-001108.wav,I'M GOING TO THEM
sample-001109.wav,YOU'RE THE HOPE OF THE WORLD
sample-001110.wav,YOU SHOULD EVALUATE IT IN A PERCEPTUAL EXPERIMENT
sample-001111.wav,THEY'D NEVER LET YOU GO
sample-001112.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
sample-001113.wav,THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sample-001114.wav,BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
sample-001115.wav,THANK YOU VERY MUCH
sample-001116.wav,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sample-001117.wav,HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
sample-001118.wav,THAT'S ALL MARK EVER TALKS ABOUT
sample-001119.wav,IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sample-001120.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-001121.wav,HE LIVES AT THE ALFAYOUM OASIS HIS FRIEND HAD SAID
sample-001122.wav,HE'S IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS
sample-001123.wav,THEY PROVIDED WARNINGS ABOUT THIEVES AND BARBARIAN TRIBES
sample-001124.wav,THEY WERE KNOWN AS SEERS AND THEY WERE HELD IN FEAR BY WOMEN AND THE ELDERLY
sample-001125.wav,MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sample-001126.wav,LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
sample-001127.wav,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sample-001128.wav,FROM THEN ON HE WOULD MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS
sample-001129.wav,I HOLD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR EVERY PERSON I TAKE WITH ME
sample-001130.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sample-001131.wav,YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
sample-001132.wav,HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
sample-001133.wav,'M ALL ABOUT THOSE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TIME AND DISTANCE
sample-001134.wav,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
sample-001135.wav,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
sample-001136.wav,THAT IS AN ANTELOPE MY SON
sample-001137.wav,I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES
sample-001138.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sample-001139.wav,IT HELPED ME TO TRUST IN PEOPLE THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED
sample-001140.wav,I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
sample-001141.wav,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER

sample-001143.wav,MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sample-001144.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
sample-001145.wav,DID YOU WANT TO SEE HER ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT
sample-001146.wav,SAYS FOR US TO GO THE LIMIT
sample-001147.wav,HE HAD FOUND WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS AND WAS FRIGHTENED AT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
sample-001148.wav,WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE
sample-001149.wav,I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL
sample-001150.wav,BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
sample-001151.wav,THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sample-001152.wav,THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE WAS SWINGING IN THE GALE
sample-001153.wav,THERE HAS BEEN A ROBBERY AT THE BURGER SHOP IN DOWNTOWN
sample-001154.wav,SHE KEEPS SAYING THAT SHE HAS NO REGRETS ABOUT MOVING BACK HOME BUT IM NOT SURE IF ITS ENTIRELY TRUE
sample-001155.wav,HE'S AFTER THE MONEY
sample-001156.wav,DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
sample-001157.wav,WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT MAN WANTED TO TRAVEL TOO
sample-001158.wav,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sample-001159.wav,THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sample-001160.wav,LOTS OF SHEPHERDS PASSED THROUGH SELLING THEIR WOOL
sample-001161.wav,SPEAK TO THE HAND THAT WROTE ALL SAID THE SUN
sample-001162.wav,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
sample-001163.wav,I WAS SITTING WITH MY BEST FRIEND WHEN HE ASKED ME HEY HANNAH CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR
sample-001164.wav,HE THOUGHT OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD TRUSTED IN THE DESERT
sample-001165.wav,YOU WON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE READING IT
sample-001166.wav,WILMAS GONE CAT SITTING AGAIN FOR THE WEEKEND IF YOU WANT TO COME OVER
sample-001167.wav,THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
sample-001168.wav,ANOTHER PERSON WAS THERE TO HELP HIM TOWARD HIS DESTINY
sample-001169.wav,THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
sample-001170.wav,THE MAN WEPT WITH HAPPINESS
sample-001171.wav,I HAD NEVER HEARD OF ALCHEMISTS BEFORE THE BOY SAID
sample-001172.wav,HE WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE MERCHANT TO AWAKEN AND OPEN THE SHOP
sample-001173.wav,THEY DON'T SEE THAT THE FIELDS ARE NEW AND THE SEASONS CHANGE
sample-001174.wav,AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
sample-001175.wav,YOU'VE GOT LIPSTICK ALL OVER YOUR MOUTH
sample-001176.wav,MACHINE GUN FIRE AWOKE THE FUGITIVES AND SENT THEM INTO A FRENZY
sample-001177.wav,I FOUND THESE ONE DAY IN THE FIELDS
sample-001178.wav,I CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY
sample-001179.wav,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sample-001180.wav,SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHT SAY IT TRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND
sample-001181.wav,EVEN FROM A DISTANCE THEIR EYES CONVEYED THE STRENGTH OF THEIR SOULS
sample-001182.wav,I NEED YOU TO BE SPONTANEOUS HE ASKED ME OUT TO DIN DIN
sample-001183.wav,WE BEAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON THAT STORY
sample-001184.wav,IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
sample-001185.wav,VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TENT
sample-001186.wav,THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
sample-001187.wav,IF HE MAKES A BUYING MISTAKE IT DOESN'T AFFECT HIM MUCH
sample-001188.wav,USED TO HUNT RABBITS THERE MYSELF
sample-001189.wav,THE GENIES WERE THE SPIRITS OF GOOD AND EVIL
sample-001190.wav,NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-001191.wav,HE PUT HIS HEADCLOTH IN PLACE AND SECURED IT WITH A RING MADE OF CAMEL SKIN
sample-001192.wav,IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
sample-001193.wav,YOU CAN'T DO THAT
sample-001194.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING
sample-001195.wav,WE CAN'T LET THE CHRONICLE GET THE LAUGH ON US
sample-001196.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-001197.wav,WHEN HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE DUNE HIS HEART LEAPT
sample-001198.wav,HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
sample-001199.wav,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sample-001200.wav,THE LITTLE GIRL WANTED TO HAVE A BALLOON BUT WAS TOO SHY TO ASK
sample-001201.wav,ARE YOU ALL RIGHT
sample-001202.wav,HE SHOULD HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A SHEPHERD THE BOY SAID
sample-001203.wav,YOU'RE HERE RATHER EARLY
sample-001204.wav,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sample-001205.wav,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sample-001206.wav,OXYGEN IS IMPORTANT FOR US BUT SOME BACTERIA DON'T NEED IT AT ALL
sample-001207.wav,BEING MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD ISN'T NONSENSE
sample-001208.wav,I'M JUST YOUR LITTLE RENT COLLECTOR
sample-001209.wav,HE QUICKLY PULLED HIS HANDS AWAY
sample-001210.wav,WE COULD GET TO THE PYRAMIDS BY TOMORROW SAID THE OTHER TAKING THE MONEY
sample-001211.wav,THE NEXT DAY THE BOY RETURNED TO THE WELL HOPING TO SEE THE GIRL
sample-001212.wav,THE BOY APPROACHED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001213.wav,SO USUALLY A KEYPRESS INSTEAD OF A CLICK IS USED
sample-001214.wav,IT'S IN ALL THE AFTERNOON PAPERS
sample-001215.wav,IF YOU CAN CONCENTRATE ALWAYS ON THE PRESENT YOU'LL BE A HAPPY MAN
sample-001216.wav,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
sample-001217.wav,YOU'VE GOT THE MAYOR AND PULLMAN BACKED AGAINST A WALL
sample-001218.wav,BUT AS HE SAW THEM LYING THERE ON THE GROUND ANOTHER PHRASE CAME TO HIS MIND
sample-001219.wav,WHAT A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY
sample-001220.wav,AND WHAT DO YOU DO IN SALEM HE INSISTED
sample-001221.wav,BUT NOW THE SOUNDS INSIDE HAD STOPPED
sample-001222.wav,HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
sample-001223.wav,I'M SENDING IT OVER WITH BETH
sample-001224.wav,YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
sample-001225.wav,THAT'S THE WAY IT ALWAYS IS SAID THE OLD MAN
sample-001226.wav,THERE'S THE PROFESSOR NOW
sample-001227.wav,I THINK IT'S ABOUT BIRD HUNTING BUT NOW I CAN SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED
sample-001228.wav,HAVE YOU SEEN HIM
sample-001229.wav,IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD DONE THAT
sample-001230.wav,IT WAS MY FEAR OF FAILURE THAT FIRST KEPT ME FROM ATTEMPTING THE MASTER WORK
sample-001231.wav,WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
sample-001232.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sample-001233.wav,THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
sample-001234.wav,I WISH I COULD REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE COLD MILKY SAK SERVED IN A BOX
sample-001235.wav,I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU ALL MORNING HE SAID AS HE LED THE BOY OUTSIDE
sample-001236.wav,WHY ARE YOU CARRYING MONEY ASKED THE TRIBESMAN WHEN HE HAD SEARCHED THE BOY'S BAG
sample-001237.wav,YOU ALL KNOW ME
sample-001238.wav,USING SCRIPT BLOCKERS IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA BUT IT REQUIRES THE USER TO LEARN A BIT
sample-001239.wav,IT IS THE MOST VALUABLE STAMP IN THE WORLD
sample-001240.wav,ALWAYS HEED THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sample-001241.wav,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sample-001242.wav,AND FOR WISE MEN GOLD IS THE METAL THAT EVOLVED THE FURTHEST
sample-001243.wav,THE STRANGER WAS SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT
sample-001244.wav,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sample-001245.wav,THE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A PERSON AND HURRIED AWAY
sample-001246.wav,AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
sample-001247.wav,GIVEN ONLY THE PUBLIC KEY IT IS VERY HARD TO COMPUTE THE PRIVATE ONE
sample-001248.wav,THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sample-001249.wav,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-001250.wav,THE TROUBLE WITH USING THIS FOR ALL ONSCREEN MOVEMENT IS THAT RECOGNITION ACCURACY ISN'T ALWAYS PERFECT
sample-001251.wav,POTATOES ARE LESS SPACESAVING DURABLE AND CHEAP THAN PASTA
sample-001252.wav,SOMETIMES THEIR CARAVAN MET WITH ANOTHER
sample-001253.wav,I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
sample-001254.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sample-001255.wav,YOU GOT YOUR WATERMELON

sample-001261.wav,HE WAS JUST AND GOOD
sample-001262.wav,YOU HAVE A MANIA FOR SIMPLIFYING EVERYTHING ANSWERED THE ENGLISHMAN IRRITATED
sample-001263.wav,THE BOY'S NAME WAS SANTIAGO
sample-001264.wav,THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
sample-001265.wav,PALM TREES GROWS TWICE AS BIG THERE
sample-001266.wav,YOU'LL TAKE FIFTY AND LIKE IT
sample-001267.wav,SO WE THEIR HEARTS SPEAK MORE AND MORE SOFTLY
sample-001268.wav,THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SUFFUSED WITH THE SWEET SCENT OF SMOKE
sample-001269.wav,HE MADE US STAND AND WATCH HIM PAINT FOR LIKE AN HOUR
sample-001270.wav,NOW I'M BEGINNING WHAT I COULD HAVE STARTED TEN YEARS AGO
sample-001271.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-001272.wav,EVERY SEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGINNER'S LUCK
sample-001273.wav,HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE
sample-001274.wav,THE HAND WITH THE WHIP POINTED TO THE SOUTH
sample-001275.wav,DID YOU EVER WALK INTO THIS OFFICE
sample-001276.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
sample-001277.wav,HE BELIEVED IN OMENS
sample-001278.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING
sample-001279.wav,MY FRIEND BOUGHT ALL THE OTHER SHEEP IMMEDIATELY
sample-001280.wav,THE BOY WAS SUDDENLY HAPPY TO BE THERE AT THE WAREHOUSE
sample-001281.wav,LUCY'S A NEWSPAPER WOMAN
sample-001282.wav,YOU KNOW I'D TELL YOU IF I HAD IT
sample-001283.wav,ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
sample-001284.wav,THEY REACHED THE CENTER OF A LARGE PLAZA WHERE THE MARKET WAS HELD
sample-001285.wav,AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001286.wav,I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME
sample-001287.wav,EVERY SEARCH BEGINS WITH BEGINNER'S LUCK
sample-001288.wav,WE RETURNED TO THE CEMETERY
sample-001289.wav,THE DESERT WITH ITS ENDLESS MONOTONY PUT HIM TO DREAMING
sample-001290.wav,LEMONS AND THYME SHOULD GO WELL
sample-001291.wav,THEY CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES
sample-001292.wav,I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
sample-001293.wav,EVERYONE IS JUST STANDING BY THE BUILDING WAITING TO GET IN
sample-001294.wav,THE OMENS HAD BEEN TRUE AFTER ALL
sample-001295.wav,BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
sample-001296.wav,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sample-001297.wav,IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
sample-001298.wav,YOU'RE GOING TO RUN INTO THE GOVERNOR
sample-001299.wav,I HOLD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR EVERY PERSON I TAKE WITH ME
sample-001300.wav,MY FATHER OFFERED HER A JOB
sample-001301.wav,HE'S TRYING TO TRICK YOU AGAIN
sample-001302.wav,IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
sample-001303.wav,TELL YOUR HEART THAT THE FEAR OF SUFFERING IS WORSE THAN THE SUFFERING ITSELF
sample-001304.wav,I HAVE NEVER SEEN A ROTHSCHILD BEFORE
sample-001305.wav,WATCH OVER HER TONIGHT
sample-001306.wav,THEY WERE MEN OF THE DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF SORCERERS
sample-001307.wav,I'D BETTER SEE WHAT HE'S UP TO
sample-001308.wav,YOUR DENTIST CALLED YESTERDAY
sample-001309.wav,THAT WAS HIS WORK
sample-001310.wav,THE CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY THE WAREHOUSE BOSS
sample-001311.wav,SANDRA READ ALOUD THE STRANGE EXCERPT
sample-001312.wav,STANLEY FELT EXHILARATED
sample-001313.wav,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sample-001314.wav,I WON'T EVER TELL A SOUL
sample-001315.wav,TELL THEM IT'S A CASE OF SERIOUS DELIRIUM
sample-001316.wav,IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
sample-001317.wav,I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FOR MYSELF
sample-001318.wav,I JUST WANT TO DREAM ABOUT MECCA
sample-001319.wav,NEVER GIVE UP
sample-001320.wav,A PRACTICE OF INFIDELS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
sample-001321.wav,YET EACH FELT HIS HEART BEAT A BIT FASTER
sample-001322.wav,THE TWO MEN EXCHANGED SOME WORDS IN ARABIC AND THE BAR OWNER SEEMED IRRITATED
sample-001323.wav,HEY WHAT DO YOU SAY
sample-001324.wav,STOP TREATING ME LIKE A CHILD
sample-001325.wav,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
sample-001326.wav,THEY DON'T SEE THAT THE FIELDS ARE NEW AND THE SEASONS CHANGE
sample-001327.wav,DESPAIR IS SOMETHING THAT HAUNTS US AT NIGHT
sample-001328.wav,BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING
sample-001329.wav,THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
sample-001330.wav,TEAM  WILL MEET UP AT POINT B WITH TEAM 
sample-001331.wav,YOU'LL BE THE COUNSELOR OF THE OASIS
sample-001332.wav,TURN UP THE VOLUME
sample-001333.wav,HITTING THE DELETE AND ESCAPE KEYS DID NOTHING
sample-001334.wav,SHE COMES BY IT NATURALLY
sample-001335.wav,DIDN'T I TELL YOU NEVER TO COME PANHANDLING AROUND HERE
sample-001336.wav,HOW IS MOZILLA GOING TO HANDLE AMBIGUITIES LIKE QUEUE AND CUE
sample-001337.wav,THE CLOSER HE GOT TO THE REALIZATION OF HIS DREAM THE MORE DIFFICULT THINGS BECAME
sample-001338.wav,I'LL RETURN JUST AS YOUR FATHER CAME BACK TO YOUR MOTHER HE SAID
sample-001339.wav,THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
sample-001340.wav,WHO IS IT FROM
sample-001341.wav,LIKE EATING OR SLEEPING OR LIKE SEEKING LOVE OR FINDING A JOB
sample-001342.wav,MUCH BETTER SAID THE OLD MAN
sample-001343.wav,NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND
sample-001344.wav,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
sample-001345.wav,I AIN'T GONNA SQUEAL
sample-001346.wav,AMEN
sample-001347.wav,WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE EMERALD TABLET THE BOY WANTED TO KNOW
sample-001348.wav,SEEMS LIKE IT OUGHT TO BE FIXABLE IN SOFTWARE
sample-001349.wav,MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
sample-001350.wav,I'LL JUST WATCH HIM HE SAID TO HIMSELF
sample-001351.wav,THE EXECUTION WAS CANCELLED
sample-001352.wav,CERTAINLY I'M SURE I'M COMFORTABLE
sample-001353.wav,THIS IS WHAT I WISHED FOR
sample-001354.wav,THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sample-001355.wav,THESE TROUSERS DON'T FIT VERY WELL
sample-001356.wav,ALL THINGS ARE ONE
sample-001357.wav,THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH A THICK PASTE
sample-001358.wav,I AM PROUD OF YOU HE SAID
sample-001359.wav,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sample-001360.wav,AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
sample-001361.wav,AND I'M GOING TO BUILD THINGS
sample-001362.wav,I KNEW THERE WAS SOME MISTAKE
sample-001363.wav,WILL YOU GET CLOSE TO HIM
sample-001364.wav,THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
sample-001365.wav,SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVOLVED
sample-001366.wav,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sample-001367.wav,THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
sample-001368.wav,DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
sample-001369.wav,THE ANIMALS WERE EXHAUSTED AND THE MEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES LESS AND LESS
sample-001370.wav,WALK IN THE GRASS IN MY BARE FEET
sample-001371.wav,THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
sample-001372.wav,IF WE SERVE TEA IN CRYSTAL THE SHOP IS GOING TO EXPAND
sample-001373.wav,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sample-001374.wav,BECAUSE LIFE WANTS YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR DESTINY
sample-001375.wav,THE WHOLE CREATURE HEAVED AND PULSATED CONVULSIVELY
sample-001376.wav,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sample-001377.wav,THERE'S A CARAVAN LEAVING TODAY FOR ALFAYOUM
sample-001378.wav,VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TENT
sample-001379.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
sample-001380.wav,BACON PANCAKES AND MAPLE SYRUP IS A HEARTY START TO ANY DAY
sample-001381.wav,IT WAS JUST RIPE ENOUGH TO EAT
sample-001382.wav,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
sample-001383.wav,THE ELECTRICIAN LOOKED PUZZLED
sample-001384.wav,I'LL BET YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THOSE
sample-001385.wav,SO THE WIND BLEW WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH AND THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH SAND
sample-001386.wav,THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FALLING STAR
sample-001387.wav,WHERE IS THE TREASURE HE ASKED
sample-001388.wav,IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
sample-001389.wav,WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT
sample-001390.wav,THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOSTALGIA
sample-001391.wav,THEY WENT ON SMOKING THE PIPE FOR A WHILE AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SET
sample-001392.wav,HE HAD COME TO THE TOWN ONLY TO FIND A WOMAN WHO COULD INTERPRET HIS DREAM
sample-001393.wav,WHEN HE WAS IN HOSPITAL THE NURSE TOOK AN XRAY PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS ARM
sample-001394.wav,HE WANDERED FOR A WHILE KEEPING THE DATE PALMS OF THE OASIS WITHIN SIGHT
sample-001395.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-001396.wav,HITTING THE DELETE AND ESCAPE KEYS DID NOTHING
sample-001397.wav,AND EVENTUALLY MAN WILL NOURISH YOUR SANDS WHERE THE GAME WILL ONCE AGAIN FLOURISH
sample-001398.wav,HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET HIM EXAMINED
sample-001399.wav,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
sample-001400.wav,ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sample-001401.wav,THEY WERE MEN OF THE DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF SORCERERS
sample-001402.wav,DID YOU FINISH THE INTERVIEW
sample-001403.wav,THEY HAVE THEIR EYES GLUED ON HIS FACE
sample-001404.wav,SOMETHING TERRIBLE'S HAPPENED TO ME
sample-001405.wav,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-001406.wav,HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
sample-001407.wav,BUT HE DECIDED FIRST TO BUY HIS BAKERY AND PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE
sample-001408.wav,ONLY WE CALL THEM AGENTS
sample-001409.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
sample-001410.wav,HOW THEY MANAGED TO IMPROVISE AT SUCH SHORT NOTICE SHE'LL NEVER KNOW
sample-001411.wav,AND THAT'S WHERE THE POWER OF LOVE COMES IN
sample-001412.wav,THEY WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GOLD HIS COMPANION ANSWERED
sample-001413.wav,HE WANTED TO SAY SO TO THE ALCHEMIST BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF THE MAN
sample-001414.wav,FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
sample-001415.wav,EVEN ME  I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF OTHER WOMEN SINCE I MET THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
sample-001416.wav,SO WHAT IS SALEM LIKE HE ASKED TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF CLUE
sample-001417.wav,HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
sample-001418.wav,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
sample-001419.wav,THE DESERT DIDN'T ANSWER HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS
sample-001420.wav,JANET ROGER DIED THREE MONTHS AGO
sample-001421.wav,AND IN THAT WAY THE MONTHS PASSED
sample-001422.wav,WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO GIVING THEM A JOINT INTERVIEW
sample-001423.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
sample-001424.wav,HE REMEMBERED WHAT THE OLD MAN HAD SAID ABOUT OFFERING SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE YET
sample-001425.wav,WE COULD GET TO THE PYRAMIDS BY TOMORROW SAID THE OTHER TAKING THE MONEY
sample-001426.wav,THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
sample-001427.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-001428.wav,BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GO INTO BATTLE
sample-001429.wav,HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
sample-001430.wav,MAYBE WE'RE ALL THAT WAY THE BOY MUSED
sample-001431.wav,BUT FINALLY HE AGREED THAT THE BOY WHO SPOKE BETTER ARABIC THAN HE SHOULD DO SO
sample-001432.wav,PEOPLE SAY STRANGE THINGS THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-001433.wav,LET'S GO AND HAVE SOME LUNCH SAID THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
sample-001434.wav,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
sample-001435.wav,NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HOLLY CAME BACK LATE FROM THE OFFICE
sample-001436.wav,I WANT TO TALK TO BOTH OF YOU
sample-001437.wav,THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
sample-001438.wav,THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS KNAPSACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANK SOME
sample-001439.wav,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
sample-001440.wav,DONT SHARE YOUR OPINIONS SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS LISTENING
sample-001441.wav,I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT DREAMS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001442.wav,BENJAMIN WAS SNACKING ON STRIPS OF BACON
sample-001443.wav,THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT
sample-001444.wav,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sample-001445.wav,BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
sample-001446.wav,YOU MAY KISS MY HAND
sample-001447.wav,I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
sample-001448.wav,THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
sample-001449.wav,ALL YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS TO BE SINCERE
sample-001450.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sample-001451.wav,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
sample-001452.wav,THE SUN THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND DECIDED TO SHINE MORE BRIGHTLY
sample-001453.wav,THAT SOUNDS LIKE THEIR PROBLEM
sample-001454.wav,THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
sample-001455.wav,AND SO DO I
sample-001456.wav,THE SCALE MODEL OF THE ARCHITECTS PLANS SAT AT THE CENTER OF THE CONFERENCE ROOM
sample-001457.wav,AND SHOULDN'T THEY BE GARNISHED
sample-001458.wav,WELL WHY DON'T WE GO THERE RIGHT NOW THE BOY ASKED
sample-001459.wav,MY KEYBOARD IS FILLED WITH DUST
sample-001460.wav,HE SHOULD RESPECT TRADITION
sample-001461.wav,THIS SAMANTHA TOMMY MOVEMENT COSTS YOU A FORTUNE
sample-001462.wav,I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sample-001463.wav,IT MADE ME VERY DEPRESSED
sample-001464.wav,IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
sample-001465.wav,I AM IN SEARCH OF THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AMONG OTHER THINGS
sample-001466.wav,MR LEE CAN'T BE BOTHERED NOW
sample-001467.wav,THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
sample-001468.wav,THEY WENT TO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY
sample-001469.wav,SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
sample-001470.wav,HOW DID YOU LEARN TO READ THE GIRL ASKED AT ONE POINT
sample-001471.wav,AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
sample-001472.wav,YOU'VE HINTED IT OFTEN ENOUGH
sample-001473.wav,NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND
sample-001474.wav,YOU CAN'T STOP FOR A THING NOW
sample-001475.wav,WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
sample-001476.wav,YOU'LL HAVE TO WAKE HIM UP
sample-001477.wav,WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING
sample-001478.wav,I'M NOT GOING VERY FAR THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE HORSEMEN
sample-001479.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-001480.wav,SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP
sample-001481.wav,THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sample-001482.wav,THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
sample-001483.wav,AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHEMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS
sample-001484.wav,THEN A MAN APPROACHED
sample-001485.wav,JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
sample-001486.wav,BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE IN EITHER MY PAST OR MY FUTURE
sample-001487.wav,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sample-001488.wav,BUT WHERE ARE THE HOUSES
sample-001489.wav,ISN'T IT JUST BEAUTIFUL
sample-001490.wav,THE CARAVAN WOULD BE VERY LUCKY TO REACH THE OASIS
sample-001491.wav,I'LL JUST WATCH HIM HE SAID TO HIMSELF
sample-001492.wav,IT RATTLED MENACINGLY
sample-001493.wav,THE BOY WANTED TO TAKE HER HAND
sample-001494.wav,I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
sample-001495.wav,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
sample-001496.wav,THE SAME HAND THAT HAD BRANDISHED THE SWORD NOW HELD A WHIP
sample-001497.wav,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
sample-001498.wav,IT'S THE OTHER FOREIGNER THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-001499.wav,YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY CLEANING HE SAID
sample-001500.wav,JUST USE THE PHONE
sample-001501.wav,I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID
sample-001502.wav,IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
sample-001503.wav,I'M AFRAID THAT IF MY DREAM IS REALIZED I'LL HAVE NO REASON TO GO ON LIVING
sample-001504.wav,I'M GOING WITH YOU THE BOY SAID
sample-001505.wav,THE EMERALD TABLET IS A DIRECT PASSAGE TO THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
sample-001506.wav,AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE
sample-001507.wav,SO HE COULD NOT BE HASTY NOR IMPATIENT
sample-001508.wav,WHO IS THIS MAN
sample-001509.wav,A SEMITRANSPARENT OVERLAY PROMOTED THE BETA VERSION OF AN ANDROID APP
sample-001510.wav,MEANWHILE THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT HIS TREASURE
sample-001511.wav,I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FOR MYSELF
sample-001512.wav,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sample-001513.wav,I'M AFRAID YOU'RE BLOCKING MY VIEW
sample-001514.wav,MAYBE TOMORROW SAID THE BOY MOVING AWAY
sample-001515.wav,HE PICKED UP THE TWO STONES AND PUT THEM BACK IN HIS POUCH
sample-001516.wav,OR A MAN INTO THE WIND
sample-001517.wav,YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
sample-001518.wav,WHAT'S THAT OTHER PAPER GOING TO GIVE YOU
sample-001519.wav,I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
sample-001520.wav,THE CATERPILLAR RESPONDED WITH A NOD
sample-001521.wav,WHAT'LL I TELL HIM
sample-001522.wav,THE SHOP FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS
sample-001523.wav,THOSE GYPSIES ARE REALLY SMART HE THOUGHT
sample-001524.wav,I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES
sample-001525.wav,FEW PEOPLE REALISE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
sample-001526.wav,SOME MEN WERE SMOKING FROM A GIGANTIC PIPE THAT THEY PASSED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
sample-001527.wav,BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
sample-001528.wav,WE'RE GOING TO GLASGOW NEXT YEAR
sample-001529.wav,I WANT TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO
sample-001530.wav,THEY WERE HIS TREASURE
sample-001531.wav,A CURRENT OF LOVE RUSHED FROM HIS HEART AND THE BOY BEGAN TO PRAY
sample-001532.wav,DISREGARD MY LAST STATEMENT
sample-001533.wav,YOU'LL WATCH THEM AS THEY GROW DEMONSTRATING HOW THE WORLD IS ALWAYS CHANGING
sample-001534.wav,THE ART FESTIVAL WAS A DISASTER
sample-001535.wav,LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN
sample-001536.wav,HE REMEMBERED SOMETHING HIS GRANDFATHER HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT BUTTERFLIES WERE A GOOD OMEN
sample-001537.wav,I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO I'M TALKING TO ANY MORE
sample-001538.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVERS EXCHANGED INFORMATION ABOUT WINDSTORMS AND TOLD STORIES ABOUT THE DESERT
sample-001539.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER THOUGH SEEMED NOT TO BE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE THREAT OF WAR
sample-001540.wav,THE DOOR WAS LOCKED
sample-001541.wav,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
sample-001542.wav,HE CONDEMNED THE COMMANDER TO DEATH WITHOUT HONOR
sample-001543.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-001544.wav,VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TENT
sample-001545.wav,I WAS JUST IN TOWN EARLIER THIS YEAR SO IT IS KIND OF CRAZY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE RIGHT AFTER
sample-001546.wav,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
sample-001547.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
sample-001548.wav,HE KNEW HE WAS STRONGER THAN HIS FRIEND
sample-001549.wav,AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE WOMAN HE LOVED
sample-001550.wav,SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHT SAY IT TRAVELLED WITH A HISSING SOUND
sample-001551.wav,I'M TERRIBLY SORRY SHE ISN'T HERE
sample-001552.wav,BEFORE HIM WAS AN ENORMOUS WHITE HORSE REARING OVER HIM WITH A FRIGHTENING SCREAM
sample-001553.wav,YOU DON'T HAVE TO SMELL THE WORLD
sample-001554.wav,WHATEVER THE THING OBSERVED ONE COULD FIND A CONNECTION WITH HIS EXPERIENCE OF THE MOMENT
sample-001555.wav,WHEN YOU PLAY CARDS THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO WIN
sample-001556.wav,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
sample-001557.wav,'EVERYONE LOVED THEM AND ENJOYED THEM
sample-001558.wav,THAT BRINGS YOU GOOD LUCK FOR TEN YEARS
sample-001559.wav,YET IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LARGE FOR ASSURANCE
sample-001560.wav,AS THE ENGLISHMAN LEFT FATIMA ARRIVED AND FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER
sample-001561.wav,BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
sample-001562.wav,AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sample-001563.wav,SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALEX PRETTY WELL
sample-001564.wav,ALL WHO WENT THERE WERE HAPPY AT HAVING DONE SO
sample-001565.wav,SOME MEN WERE SMOKING FROM A GIGANTIC PIPE THAT THEY PASSED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
sample-001566.wav,AND THE LAST ONE
sample-001567.wav,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
sample-001568.wav,WE'VE BEEN FED BALONEY SO LONG WE'RE GETTING USED TO IT
sample-001569.wav,THEN WHO ARE YOU
sample-001570.wav,GO BACK TO WATCHING THE CARAVAN HE SAID
sample-001571.wav,BASED ON THE OMENS OF THE PRESENT
sample-001572.wav,SHE REVERSED THE CHARGES
sample-001573.wav,THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE BOY DUG AT THE PLACE HE HAD CHOSEN BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-001574.wav,HE TRIED AGAIN TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PINK SHADES OF THE DESERT AND ITS STONES
sample-001575.wav,LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
sample-001576.wav,WHEN HE'S AN OLD MAN HE'S GOING TO SPEND A MONTH IN AFRICA
sample-001577.wav,AND HE KNEW THAT EGYPT WAS IN AFRICA
sample-001578.wav,THINK I'LL GO HOME AND SEE WHAT THE FAMILY IS DOING
sample-001579.wav,BUT THE BOY WAS QUIET
sample-001580.wav,THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW
sample-001581.wav,THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
sample-001582.wav,ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sample-001583.wav,THE BOY WAS GETTING IRRITATED
sample-001584.wav,HE HAD DONE THIS FOR YEARS AND KNEW THE SCHEDULE OF EVERYONE WHO PASSED
sample-001585.wav,TELL THEM IT'S A CASE OF SERIOUS DELIRIUM
sample-001586.wav,DID YOU BRING THE CHRISTMAS WREATH
sample-001587.wav,BUT YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL
sample-001588.wav,DO YOU WANT TO GO TO WORK FOR ME THE MERCHANT ASKED
sample-001589.wav,THANKS FOR THE STORY AND GOOD LUCK ON YOUR HONEYMOON
sample-001590.wav,ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND
sample-001591.wav,DID YOU MAKE A SPEECH
sample-001592.wav,AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY
sample-001593.wav,YOU'D BETTER START RIGHT NOW
sample-001594.wav,NO ONE CAN BE FROM MANY PLACES THE BOY SAID

sample-001614.wav,BUT CHILDREN ALWAYS SEEM TO BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH THEM WITHOUT FRIGHTENING THEM
sample-001615.wav,IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TALKING TO HIS SHEEP
sample-001616.wav,THE EMERALD TABLET IS A DIRECT PASSAGE TO THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
sample-001617.wav,BUT THE BOY SAT DOWN AND WAITED
sample-001618.wav,I DON'T SEE A THING

sample-001641.wav,THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PRINTING PRESS IN THOSE DAYS THE BOY ARGUED
sample-001642.wav,IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sample-001643.wav,THE WOMAN SAID SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A PERSON AND HURRIED AWAY
sample-001644.wav,I USED TO LOOK AT THOSE WOMEN AND ENVY THEM THEIR HAPPINESS

sample-001699.wav,THE ALCHEMISTS SPENT YEARS IN THEIR LABORATORIES OBSERVING THE FIRE THAT PURIFIED THE METALS
sample-001700.wav,THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY'RE WALKING A NEW ROAD EVERY DAY

sample-001736.wav,THEY BOTH SPOKE THE SAME LANGUAGE
sample-001737.wav,AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sample-001738.wav,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
sample-001739.wav,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sample-001740.wav,SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
sample-001741.wav,IT'S STILL SOPPING WET

sample-001779.wav,GIVE ME MY ROBE
sample-001780.wav,HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF INTO A STONE THAT ROLLED UP TO THE MINER'S FOOT
sample-001781.wav,THEN IT BECAME A SIGNAL OF DANGER
sample-001782.wav,LOOKING AT THE SUN HE CALCULATED THAT HE WOULD REACH TARIFA BEFORE MIDDAY

sample-001798.wav,I AM HERE THE BOY SAID
sample-001799.wav,IT WAS DROPPING OFF IN FLAKES AND RAINING DOWN ON THE SAND

sample-001818.wav,TWO DAYS AGO YOU SAID THAT I HAD NEVER DREAMED OF TRAVEL THE MERCHANT ANSWERED

sample-001866.wav,THE ALCHEMIST TOLD THE BOY TO PLACE THE SHELL OVER HIS EAR
sample-001867.wav,LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN
sample-001868.wav,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
sample-001869.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT

sample-001883.wav,THAT'S WHAT I WAS SENT DOWN FOR
sample-001884.wav,IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND
sample-001885.wav,BUT I'M GOING IN SEARCH OF MY TREASURE THE BOY SAID

sample-001900.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN DIDN'T ANSWER HIM DIRECTLY
sample-001901.wav,MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE THEY MOVED AROUND SO MUCH
sample-001902.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN SAID NOTHING
sample-001903.wav,THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN READERS EXPECTATIONS CREATED BY THE TEXT AND THE REAL BEHAVIOUR SHOULD BE RESOLVED
sample-001904.wav,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN AND NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS

sample-001925.wav,ABOUT TIME ONE OF YOU LUNKHEADS SAID IT
sample-001926.wav,THIS IS FOR YOU
sample-001927.wav,ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sample-001928.wav,WHAT'S FOR DINNER TONIGHT
sample-001929.wav,THE BOY STEPPED CLOSER TO THE GIRL AND WHEN SHE SMILED HE DID THE SAME
sample-001930.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sample-001931.wav,THIS MAN'S GOING TO JUMP AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE
sample-001932.wav,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sample-001933.wav,THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER
sample-001934.wav,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
sample-001935.wav,THE DESERT DIDN'T ANSWER HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS
sample-001936.wav,I WANT MY BABY TO LOOK LIKE YOU
sample-001937.wav,THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD
sample-001938.wav,TODAY I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING I DIDN'T SEE BEFORE EVERY BLESSING IGNORED BECOMES A CURSE
sample-001939.wav,IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND
sample-001940.wav,WELL HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THE OLD MAN SAID
sample-001941.wav,SOMETIME DURING THE SECOND YEAR YOU'LL REMEMBER ABOUT THE TREASURE
sample-001942.wav,THE OMENS HAD BEEN TRUE AFTER ALL
sample-001943.wav,AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
sample-001944.wav,THE BOY KNEW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CITY
sample-001945.wav,THE AREA WAS SWIRLING IN DUST SO INTENSE THAT IT HID THE MOON FROM VIEW
sample-001946.wav,HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
sample-001947.wav,WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK NEAL ABOUT IT
sample-001948.wav,THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
sample-001949.wav,WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE CALLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
sample-001950.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sample-001951.wav,AND I THINK IT'S TERRIFIC
sample-001952.wav,HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS
sample-001953.wav,ONCE YOU GET INTO THE DESERT THERE'S NO GOING BACK SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sample-001954.wav,JUST TELL THEM MARGE SENT YOU
sample-001955.wav,IT HELPED ME TO TRUST IN PEOPLE THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED
sample-001956.wav,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
sample-001957.wav,THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
sample-001958.wav,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
sample-001959.wav,NO BASELINES OR COMPARISON TO STATE OF THE ART IS PROVIDED
sample-001960.wav,THEY WERE SPACED OUT IN ROWS THREE FEET APART
sample-001961.wav,AND IN THAT MOOD HE WAS GRATEFUL TO BE IN LOVE
sample-001962.wav,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sample-001963.wav,THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ROMANTIC
sample-001964.wav,IS THIS THE EAR YOU CAN'T HEAR ON
sample-001965.wav,HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sample-001966.wav,I'M GOING AWAY HE SAID
sample-001967.wav,THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
sample-001968.wav,BUT HIS HEART WAS SPEAKING OF OTHER THINGS
sample-001969.wav,ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
sample-001970.wav,NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT
sample-001971.wav,THE BOY'S NAME WAS SANTIAGO
sample-001972.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sample-001973.wav,BUT THERE THEY SAW A CRYSTAL SHOP THAT OFFERED REFRESHING MINT TEA
sample-001974.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sample-001975.wav,YOU'LL BE THE COUNSELOR OF THE OASIS
sample-001976.wav,SHALL I ANNOUNCE YOU
sample-001977.wav,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sample-001978.wav,THIS REQUIRES A LITTLE THOUGHT HERE
sample-001979.wav,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sample-001980.wav,SHE'S ON THE AIR
sample-001981.wav,THE SPACE STATION ROCKED VIOLENTLY DUE TO THE INTENSE PRESSURE WAVE FROM THE AIRLOCK FAILURE
sample-001982.wav,WELL WHY DON'T WE GO THERE RIGHT NOW THE BOY ASKED
sample-001983.wav,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sample-001984.wav,IF GOOD THINGS ARE COMING THEY WILL BE A PLEASANT SURPRISE SAID THE SEER
sample-001985.wav,FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
sample-001986.wav,KIDNEYS ARE TRANSPLANTED OFTEN BECAUSE EVERY HEALTHY PERSON HAS TWO OF THEM
sample-001987.wav,SHE WILL ALSO ANNOUNCE THE THIRD PARTY'S CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY
sample-001988.wav,HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
sample-001989.wav,A MONK DRESSED IN BLACK CAME TO THE GATES
sample-001990.wav,COME ON IN THE OFFICE HERE
sample-001991.wav,IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS THAT HE COVERED IN AN HOUR
sample-001992.wav,THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
sample-001993.wav,YOU GAVE THEM EVERYTHING I HAD THE BOY SAID
sample-001994.wav,IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL
sample-001995.wav,I'M GOING AWAY HE SAID
sample-001996.wav,I JUMPED IN TO SAVE RACHEL
sample-001997.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
sample-001998.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
sample-001999.wav,IF HE MAKES A BUYING MISTAKE IT DOESN'T AFFECT HIM MUCH
sample-002000.wav,THE BOY FELT A PANG IN HIS HEART THINKING ABOUT THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
sample-002001.wav,WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
sample-002002.wav,I THOUGHT THAT SOMEDAY I'D BE RICH AND COULD GO TO MECCA
sample-002003.wav,NOBODY'D EVER TELL YOU WHOEVER IT WAS BECAUSE THEY'D BE SCARED
sample-002004.wav,DID YOU SEE THE GARDEN THAT IT TOOK THE MASTER GARDENER TEN YEARS TO CREATE
sample-002005.wav,I SAID GOOD NIGHT
sample-002006.wav,NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND
sample-002007.wav,TANGIER IS NOT LIKE THE REST OF AFRICA
sample-002008.wav,THOSE WOMEN ARE ALL CARD SHARKS DON'T BE FOOLED
sample-002009.wav,AND FOR WISE MEN GOLD IS THE METAL THAT EVOLVED THE FURTHEST
sample-002010.wav,YOU'LL BE THE COUNSELOR OF THE OASIS
sample-002011.wav,HE HAD FOUND WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS AND WAS FRIGHTENED AT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
sample-002012.wav,KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON
sample-002013.wav,WORK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
sample-002014.wav,I NEED A DRINK
sample-002015.wav,HE DECANTED THE WINE AND BEGAN TO RECOUNT THE DISTURBING STORY HE HAD BEEN TOLD
sample-002016.wav,THE CARAVANS HAD BEEN STOPPED AT GIZA FOR SOME TIME WAITING FOR THE WARS TO END
sample-002017.wav,ALMOST EVERYONE HERE SPEAKS SPANISH
sample-002018.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
sample-002019.wav,I WANT THEM BOTH ARRESTED
sample-002020.wav,THE LIST WAS FRIGHTENINGLY EXTENSIVE
sample-002021.wav,IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HERE
sample-002022.wav,I WANT MY BABY TO LOOK LIKE YOU
sample-002023.wav,I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
sample-002024.wav,JUDGE MAY NOT THINK SO
sample-002025.wav,EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
sample-002026.wav,TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL
sample-002027.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
sample-002028.wav,HAVE TRUSTED MORE IN YOUR LOVE FOR FATIMA
sample-002029.wav,HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sample-002030.wav,SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANDS I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
sample-002031.wav,THE MINER HAD ABANDONED EVERYTHING TO GO MINING FOR EMERALDS
sample-002032.wav,HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
sample-002033.wav,TRY IT AGAIN
sample-002034.wav,IT WAS A BUNDLE OF MONEY
sample-002035.wav,THE LOAFERS AND GOLF CADDIES WERE USED TO HANGING OUT NEAR THE RAILWAY STATION
sample-002036.wav,IT'S GONNA PUT OUR CITY ON THE MAP
sample-002037.wav,THE CROW TILTED ITS HEAD AS IF IT WAS THINKING
sample-002038.wav,THERE WERE RAISED VOICESAND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON 
sample-002039.wav,ON THE SEVENTH DAY THE ALCHEMIST DECIDED TO MAKE CAMP EARLIER THAN USUAL
sample-002040.wav,THE SNAKE JETTED VENOM
sample-002041.wav,THE BOY WATCHED AS HIS COMPANION WENT TO HIS HORSE AND WITHDREW A SCIMITAR
sample-002042.wav,WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT OMENS THE BOY'S INTEREST WAS INCREASING BY THE MOMENT
sample-002043.wav,ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sample-002044.wav,ABOUT HOW WEALTHY WOULD YOU SAY
sample-002045.wav,HIS SOUL MUST BE TOO PRIMITIVE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS HE THOUGHT
sample-002046.wav,WE LIT THE LANTERN AND WALKED OVER TO HIS HOUSE
sample-002047.wav,THE THREE FELL SILENT
sample-002048.wav,DON'T THEY USUALLY KEEP THE GUN ON THE FLOOR
sample-002049.wav,I'M A SUCKER FOR THIS COUNTRY
sample-002050.wav,HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
sample-002051.wav,I LEFT MY FATHER MY MOTHER AND THE TOWN CASTLE BEHIND
sample-002052.wav,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
sample-002053.wav,ABOUT TIME ONE OF YOU LUNKHEADS SAID IT
sample-002054.wav,NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-002055.wav,WITH THIS KIND OF ORGANIZATION I FIND IT'S MUCH EASIER TO PRIORITIZE WITHIN A CATEGORY
sample-002056.wav,CONGRESSMAN AARON IS HERE TO SEE YOU
sample-002057.wav,WHEN I'M EATING THAT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT
sample-002058.wav,TONIGHT WE GIVE YOU SOMETHING ENTIRELY NEW AND DIFFERENT
sample-002059.wav,THIS MAN'S GOING TO JUMP AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE
sample-002060.wav,PARACETAMOL SHOULD GET RID OF THAT PAIN

sample-002062.wav,HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sample-002063.wav,IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sample-002064.wav,IT WAS A USEFUL REMINDER TO COMPLETE THE TASK
sample-002065.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sample-002066.wav,I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
sample-002067.wav,WELL WHY DON'T WE GO THERE RIGHT NOW THE BOY ASKED
sample-002068.wav,GO BACK TO WATCHING THE CARAVAN HE SAID
sample-002069.wav,HE FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE AWOKE THE SUN WAS ALREADY HIGH
sample-002070.wav,I HAD TO ACT QUICKLY THAT'S WHY I JUMPED IN
sample-002071.wav,THE SWORD DIDN'T FALL
sample-002072.wav,I WAITED ALL AFTERNOON AND EVENING HE SAID
sample-002073.wav,THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS OGILVY AND HENDERSON HAD LEFT IT
sample-002074.wav,BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHEAR FOUR SHEEP
sample-002075.wav,ALL I SAY IS SPIT THEM OUT
sample-002076.wav,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH

sample-002090.wav,I'M TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING BEFORE THOSE REPORTERS GET BACK
sample-002091.wav,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sample-002092.wav,JOHNATHAN ASSESSED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY
sample-002093.wav,HE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT IN TARIFA THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO INTERPRETED DREAMS
sample-002094.wav,THE BOY BEGAN TO DIG INTO THE DUNE
sample-002095.wav,ADVANCING SLOWLY THEY SEARCHED AMONG THE STONES
sample-002096.wav,CAN I HELP YOU ASKED THE MAN BEHIND THE WINDOW
sample-002097.wav,IT'S TRUE THAT EVERYTHING HAS ITS DESTINY BUT ONE DAY THAT DESTINY WILL BE REALIZED
sample-002098.wav,EVERYTHING I SAY IS RIGHT

sample-002101.wav,WHO'D YOU SAY WAS GONNA GET HIM
sample-002102.wav,WHO DO YOU WANT
sample-002103.wav,THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sample-002104.wav,YOU'D BETTER TAKE IT EASY
sample-002105.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT
sample-002106.wav,IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sample-002107.wav,BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
sample-002108.wav,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sample-002109.wav,I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sample-002110.wav,I'LL JUST GO UPSTAIRS AND SEND IT OVER WITH A MESSENGER
sample-002111.wav,SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
sample-002112.wav,IT WAS THE SECOND OR THIRD TIME THEY'D TRIED
sample-002113.wav,MAYBE NO ONE HERE KNOWS WHAT AN ALCHEMIST IS
sample-002114.wav,AS I WATCHED THE PLANET SEEMED TO GROW LARGER AND SMALLER
sample-002115.wav,AND THEIR EYES SPOKE OF DEATH
sample-002116.wav,THERE'S NOT A REASON ON EARTH WHY YOU SHOULD
sample-002117.wav,MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT

sample-002134.wav,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sample-002135.wav,AND THEIR EYES SPOKE OF DEATH
sample-002136.wav,THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
sample-002137.wav,WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WAR WILL END SO WE CAN'T CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY HE SAID
sample-002138.wav,A DROUGHT HIT WESTERN EUROPE

sample-002149.wav,THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
sample-002150.wav,AFTER TWO HOURS HE RETURNED TO THE ROOM WHERE THE WISE MAN WAS
sample-002151.wav,READING BETWEEN THE LINES REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING
sample-002152.wav,THE ALCHEMIST REMOVED THE PAN FROM THE FIRE AND SET IT ASIDE TO COOL
sample-002153.wav,I JUST WANT TO DREAM ABOUT MECCA
sample-002154.wav,I WAS RIGHT THERE AND SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES
sample-002155.wav,DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY

sample-002165.wav,ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS
sample-002166.wav,BE SURE YOU SPELL THE NAME RIGHT
sample-002167.wav,IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
sample-002168.wav,I HOLD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR EVERY PERSON I TAKE WITH ME
sample-002169.wav,I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
sample-002170.wav,HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A SNAKE

sample-002172.wav,THE TRAIN LINES PROVIDED AN EASY PATH TO FOLLOW
sample-002173.wav,I FELT A CHILL DOWN MY SPINE
sample-002174.wav,IT WAS ENGINEERING AT ITS FINEST

sample-002188.wav,THE OLD WOMAN HAD SAID THE SAME THING

sample-002219.wav,I WAS TORN BETWEEN FEAR AND CURIOSITY
sample-002220.wav,THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
sample-002221.wav,SOMETIMES THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO HOLD BACK THE RIVER
sample-002222.wav,WHEN YOU ARE LOVED YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IN CREATION
sample-002223.wav,ALBERT DIDN'T HAVE A BROTHER

sample-002225.wav,HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS
sample-002226.wav,AND YOU KNOW IT AS WELL AS I DO
sample-002227.wav,WITH THE WARS BETWEEN THE TRIBES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSS THE DESERT
sample-002228.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sample-002229.wav,I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DESERT SAID
sample-002230.wav,IN ANY CASE THE DESERT WAS IMPASSABLE
sample-002231.wav,YOU COULD HAVE DIED AFTER PEACE HAD BEEN DECLARED

sample-002241.wav,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sample-002242.wav,I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
sample-002243.wav,THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD
sample-002244.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
sample-002245.wav,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
sample-002246.wav,IF I HAD TOLD YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THE PYRAMIDS
sample-002247.wav,HE REMEMBERED WHAT THE OLD MAN HAD SAID ABOUT OFFERING SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE YET
sample-002248.wav,IT'S CANDICE NOW ON LONG DISTANCE FROM WASHINGTON
sample-002249.wav,EVEN THE GUIDES SPOKE VERY LITTLE TO ONE ANOTHER
sample-002250.wav,IT'S A SIMPLE STORY
sample-002251.wav,SHE'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND
sample-002252.wav,IT CONSIDERS THE HORIZONTAL DIMENSION AS TIME
sample-002253.wav,THEY ENJOYED THE SILENCE
sample-002254.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sample-002255.wav,ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sample-002256.wav,HE WON'T LEAVE THE CIRCLE
sample-002257.wav,THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AND THEN IRRITATED
sample-002258.wav,BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
sample-002259.wav,A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sample-002260.wav,MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
sample-002261.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sample-002262.wav,I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY
sample-002263.wav,WHY WAS IT THAT HE WANTED THE BOY TO SERVE AS HIS INSTRUMENT
sample-002264.wav,NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
sample-002265.wav,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-002266.wav,WHERE'S THE OLD GOAT
sample-002267.wav,THEY RODE FOR THE ENTIRE DAY
sample-002268.wav,WE'RE JUST TRAVELERS THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-002269.wav,HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sample-002270.wav,I'M SURPRISED THE BOY SAID
sample-002271.wav,HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN WRONG
sample-002272.wav,AND THE LEADER POSTED ARMED SENTINELS AT THE FRINGES OF THE GROUP
sample-002273.wav,YOU'D BETTER START RIGHT NOW
sample-002274.wav,IT MEANS MY JOB
sample-002275.wav,I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sample-002276.wav,BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
sample-002277.wav,GOTTA BE GENTLE TO SUIT ME
sample-002278.wav,HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
sample-002279.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
sample-002280.wav,HE HAD NOT A CENT IN HIS POCKET BUT HE HAD FAITH
sample-002281.wav,HE THOUGHT THAT WITH SOME PATIENCE HE'D BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM EVERYTHING INTO GOLD
sample-002282.wav,THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
sample-002283.wav,HE ALMOST BEGAN TO TELL ABOUT HIS TREASURE BUT DECIDED NOT TO DO SO
sample-002284.wav,IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TALKING TO HIS SHEEP
sample-002285.wav,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
sample-002286.wav,THE MONEY IS UNIMPORTANT
sample-002287.wav,THE POLICE FINALLY MANAGE TO GET HIM OUT OF THE PARK
sample-002288.wav,HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
sample-002289.wav,HUNDREDS OF OBSERVERS SAW THE FLAME THAT NIGHT AND THE NIGHT AFTER
sample-002290.wav,IT MUST BE SOME KIND OF A GAG
sample-002291.wav,YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR WINGS YET
sample-002292.wav,HE WAS EXCITED AND AT THE SAME TIME UNEASY MAYBE THE GIRL HAD ALREADY FORGOTTEN HIM
sample-002293.wav,THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
sample-002294.wav,NEXT TIME WE ARE GOING TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY
sample-002295.wav,IF WHAT ONE FINDS IS MADE OF PURE MATTER IT WILL NEVER SPOIL
sample-002296.wav,DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT
sample-002297.wav,BUT MEN BEGAN TO REJECT SIMPLE THINGS AND TO WRITE TRACTS INTERPRETATIONS AND PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
sample-002298.wav,PEOPLE SAW ME COMING AND WELCOMED ME HE THOUGHT
sample-002299.wav,I'M AFRAID THAT IF MY DREAM IS REALIZED I'LL HAVE NO REASON TO GO ON LIVING
sample-002300.wav,THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
sample-002301.wav,VENUS IS FAR TOO HOT FOR EXPLORATION
sample-002302.wav,OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
sample-002303.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sample-002304.wav,THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP
sample-002305.wav,AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY
sample-002306.wav,AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHEMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS
sample-002307.wav,THIS PUTS ME IN A PECULIAR HOLE
sample-002308.wav,AND SHE ALREADY HAS HER TREASURE IT'S YOU
sample-002309.wav,LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID
sample-002310.wav,HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
sample-002311.wav,THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
sample-002312.wav,FINALLY A YOUNG WOMAN APPROACHED WHO WAS NOT DRESSED IN BLACK
sample-002313.wav,LET'S DANCE
sample-002314.wav,HE TOOK THE FOURTH PART AND HANDED IT TO THE MONK
sample-002315.wav,BETWEEN ROAST BEEF AND POTATOES HOW CAN WE LOSE
sample-002316.wav,IT WAS A COBRA WHOSE VENOM COULD KILL A PERSON IN MINUTES
sample-002317.wav,I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE IN A WAY
sample-002318.wav,WHENEVER HE SAW THE SEA OR A FIRE HE FELL SILENT IMPRESSED BY THEIR ELEMENTAL FORCE
sample-002319.wav,HOW'D YOU HAPPEN TO FALL IN
sample-002320.wav,THE OMENS WILL BEGIN INSISTENTLY TO SPEAK OF IT AND YOU'LL TRY TO IGNORE THEM
sample-002321.wav,THE STEEL OF ITS BLADE GLITTERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
sample-002322.wav,I FIND THE OTHER ARGUMENT DUBIOUS
sample-002323.wav,THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
sample-002324.wav,IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
sample-002325.wav,YOU HAVE BEEN A REAL BLESSING TO ME
sample-002326.wav,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
sample-002327.wav,YET EACH FELT HIS HEART BEAT A BIT FASTER
sample-002328.wav,ISN'T IT JUST BEAUTIFUL
sample-002329.wav,THEY WERE MEN OF THE DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF SORCERERS
sample-002330.wav,HE SAT LOOKING AT THE SKY FOR A LONG TIME
sample-002331.wav,A THIN CIRCLE OF BRIGHT METAL SHOWED BETWEEN THE TOP AND THE BODY OF THE CYLINDER
sample-002332.wav,I DON'T LIKE COCONUTS
sample-002333.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sample-002334.wav,THEN THE OLD MAN BEGAN TO INSPECT THE SHEEP AND HE SAW THAT ONE WAS LAME
sample-002335.wav,AND I SAY MAYBE YOU BOTH HAVE IT
sample-002336.wav,I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
sample-002337.wav,THERE WASN'T MUCH IMPETUS TO FINISH OUR CHORES
sample-002338.wav,HIS SOUL MUST BE TOO PRIMITIVE TO UNDERSTAND THOSE THINGS HE THOUGHT
sample-002339.wav,MY MOTHER JUST CALLED YOU
sample-002340.wav,THE WAR IS GOING TO END SOMEDAY THE GIRL SAID
sample-002341.wav,HTML IS NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
sample-002342.wav,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sample-002343.wav,THERE WAS A SMALL BUILDING THERE WITH A WINDOW AT WHICH PEOPLE BOUGHT TICKETS TO AFRICA
sample-002344.wav,DROP THE WHOLE BUSINESS QUICKLY
sample-002345.wav,HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sample-002346.wav,THESE HEADPHONES PLAY MUSIC VERY CLEARLY IN MY EARS
sample-002347.wav,I'VE JUST SWORN IN FOUR HUNDRED DEPUTIES
sample-002348.wav,I'M GOING INTO THE DESERT THE MAN ANSWERED TURNING BACK TO HIS READING
sample-002349.wav,THAT'S WHAT I DID BEFORE I MARRIED CHARLES
sample-002350.wav,THE DRIVER GOT KNOCKED COLD
sample-002351.wav,IT'S THE OASIS SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sample-002352.wav,THE LETTER AIN'T WORTH NOTHING
sample-002353.wav,WHY DO YOU WANT TO FIND THAT SORT OF PERSON THE ARAB ASKED
sample-002354.wav,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sample-002355.wav,WHEN I HAD MY SHEEP I WAS HAPPY AND I MADE THOSE AROUND ME HAPPY
sample-002356.wav,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-002357.wav,BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY
sample-002358.wav,I'D BETTER SEE WHAT HE'S UP TO
sample-002359.wav,A BOY CAME RUNNING TOWARDS ME
sample-002360.wav,I AM IN SEARCH OF THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AMONG OTHER THINGS
sample-002361.wav,THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE
sample-002362.wav,STILL AFTER THAT FIRST MILLION BEFORE YOU'RE THIRTY
sample-002363.wav,THE BOY CLOSED HIS BOOK
sample-002364.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES IN TRANSLATION THAT MIGHT ARISE
sample-002365.wav,TODAY I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING I DIDN'T SEE BEFORE EVERY BLESSING IGNORED BECOMES A CURSE
sample-002366.wav,WHO DO YOU WANT
sample-002367.wav,THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
sample-002368.wav,THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
sample-002369.wav,AND FINALLY THE FALCON RETURNED WITH THEIR MEAL
sample-002370.wav,LOTS OF PLACES SELL TEA AROUND HERE THE MERCHANT SAID
sample-002371.wav,HE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT IN TARIFA THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHO INTERPRETED DREAMS
sample-002372.wav,ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS
sample-002373.wav,DON'T BE IMPATIENT HE REPEATED TO HIMSELF
sample-002374.wav,BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE AND DIDN'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY
sample-002375.wav,ALL THEY THINK ABOUT IS FOOD AND WATER
sample-002376.wav,THIS CAN'T BE STRESSED ENOUGH I AM INNOCENT HE CRIED DESPERATELY
sample-002377.wav,I WON A FLOWER
sample-002378.wav,THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING SITUATION
sample-002379.wav,THIS CUP IS MADE OF POLYSTYRENE
sample-002380.wav,THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sample-002381.wav,WE'LL LEAVE TOMORROW BEFORE SUNRISE WAS THE ALCHEMIST'S ONLY RESPONSE
sample-002382.wav,BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
sample-002383.wav,THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTATING ON ITS BODY
sample-002384.wav,I AM FATHER NOW CAN YOU BELIEVE IT
sample-002385.wav,AND WHAT DO YOU DO IN SALEM HE INSISTED
sample-002386.wav,THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE BECOME FRIENDS BUT THE ENGLISHMAN CLOSED OFF THE CONVERSATION
sample-002387.wav,LIKE EATING OR SLEEPING OR LIKE SEEKING LOVE OR FINDING A JOB
sample-002388.wav,I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU
sample-002389.wav,HE WAS SELLING BETTER THAN EVER
sample-002390.wav,BUT MAYBE I'LL NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO GET TO THE PYRAMIDS IN EGYPT
sample-002391.wav,THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
sample-002392.wav,WE KNOW THAT AND WE ARE USED TO IT
sample-002393.wav,YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sample-002394.wav,AS HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO PULL OUT THE ROCKS HE ENCOUNTERED HE HEARD FOOTSTEPS
sample-002395.wav,HE'S ON THE WAY
sample-002396.wav,I NEVER KNEW HE HAD A DIARY
sample-002397.wav,AND TOMORROW HIS ENEMY WOULD ALSO BE A PART OF THAT SOUL
sample-002398.wav,I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT
sample-002399.wav,YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM YOUR HEART
sample-002400.wav,THE DAY WAS DAWNING AND THE SHEPHERD URGED HIS SHEEP IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUN
sample-002401.wav,NEXT MORNING THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND ARMED MEN SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE PALM TREES AT AL FAYOUM
sample-002402.wav,AND HE CAME DOWN AFTER THE GAME WITH A CONTRACT
sample-002403.wav,DID YOU ACTUALLY GIVE TAMARA THAT GUN
sample-002404.wav,THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AND THEN IRRITATED
sample-002405.wav,THE STRANGER WAS SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT
sample-002406.wav,WHEN YOU FIND A BUG IN SOFTWARE PLEASE REPORT IT
sample-002407.wav,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
sample-002408.wav,THANKS FOR DROPPING AROUND
sample-002409.wav,WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF WE WERE LIKE THAT
sample-002410.wav,I BEG OF YOU NOT TO DO THIS THING
sample-002411.wav,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
sample-002412.wav,SUPPOSE THERE WAS A SHANE YORK AND HE WALKED INTO THIS OFFICE
sample-002413.wav,THE CHARCOAL BURNED AWAY TO WHITE ASH
sample-002414.wav,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sample-002415.wav,HE NOTICED THE UNEQUAL COOLING OF ITS SURFACE
sample-002416.wav,I STILL HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO TURN MYSELF INTO THE WIND THE BOY REPEATED
sample-002417.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
sample-002418.wav,BUT THE BOY SAT DOWN AND WAITED
sample-002419.wav,AT MOST THEY THOUGHT THAT ANOTHER METEORITE HAD DESCENDED
sample-002420.wav,WE'RE REFUGEES FROM THE TRIBAL WARS AND WE NEED MONEY THE OTHER FIGURE SAID
sample-002421.wav,HIS ARM SEEMED TO BE BATTLING WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THE HOLE
sample-002422.wav,I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
sample-002423.wav,THEY PLACED IT IN A WOODEN BOX AND LEFT IT THERE FOR GOOD
sample-002424.wav,YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
sample-002425.wav,YOUR HUSBAND MUST HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT HURRY
sample-002426.wav,HE DIDN'T WANT ANY CONVERSATION AT THIS POINT
sample-002427.wav,WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sample-002428.wav,THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
sample-002429.wav,TO SHOW YOU ONE OF LIFE'S SIMPLE LESSONS THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-002430.wav,THE CUSHION WAS SOFT AND INVITING
sample-002431.wav,HE PLACED URIM AND THUMMIM IN THE CHEST
sample-002432.wav,I DONE MY BEST
sample-002433.wav,SOMETIMES THEIR CARAVAN MET WITH ANOTHER
sample-002434.wav,JUPITER HAS A GREAT RED SPOT
sample-002435.wav,NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-002436.wav,ANOTHER TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-002437.wav,AND GOT IT OUT AS SOON AS YOU CAN
sample-002438.wav,I'LL NEVER GET THIS SPEECH RIGHT
sample-002439.wav,THERE WAS A FOREST FIRE IN LOS ANGELES
sample-002440.wav,THERE'S NOT A REASON ON EARTH WHY YOU SHOULD
sample-002441.wav,ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN MAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sample-002442.wav,THANK YOU SAID THE BOY
sample-002443.wav,IS THE HEAD BETTER
sample-002444.wav,HOW COULD IT BE AWKWARD
sample-002445.wav,HE RAN HIS FINGERS SLOWLY OVER THE STONES SENSING THEIR TEMPERATURE AND FEELING THEIR SURFACES
sample-002446.wav,A LARGE PORTION OF THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN UNCOVERED
sample-002447.wav,HE HAD NEVER IMAGINED THAT QUESTIONS ABOUT LIFE WOULD BE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE TO A SHEPHERD
sample-002448.wav,MY JOB REQUIRES A LOT OF TRAVELLING
sample-002449.wav,BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
sample-002450.wav,HE COULD ALWAYS BECOME A CRYSTAL SALESMAN AGAIN
sample-002451.wav,I WONDER HOW MANY TIMES A YEAR THIS HAPPENS
sample-002452.wav,I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR VOICE TO PROJECT COMMON VOICE
sample-002453.wav,I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE SHEEP ARE AFRAID OF STRANGERS
sample-002454.wav,A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT SEVERAL LANGUAGES WERE SPOKEN IN THE SHOP
sample-002455.wav,I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
sample-002456.wav,HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF
sample-002457.wav,I'LL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS I HAVE SOMETHING
sample-002458.wav,SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sample-002459.wav,WILL YOU GIVE ME THOSE STAMPS
sample-002460.wav,HE'S INSANE OR DRUNK OR SOMETHING
sample-002461.wav,WHEN I RETURNED TO THE COMMON THE SUN WAS SETTING
sample-002462.wav,YOU CALLED THAT NUMBER NOT TEN MINUTES AGO
sample-002463.wav,THE OLD MAN GAVE A SIGNAL AND EVERYONE STOOD
sample-002464.wav,THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sample-002465.wav,I WANT TO DO WHAT I WANT TO DO
sample-002466.wav,DID YOU SEE THE GARDEN THAT IT TOOK THE MASTER GARDENER TEN YEARS TO CREATE
sample-002467.wav,AND I'M CERTAIN YOU'LL FIND IT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sample-002468.wav,THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL SEE THAT AND YOU'LL BE DISMISSED FROM YOUR POSITION AS COUNSELOR
sample-002469.wav,LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
sample-002470.wav,IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIREWOOD WITH A TRANSPARENT FLASK HEATING ON TOP
sample-002471.wav,I DIDN'T FALL IN
sample-002472.wav,CAN I AT LEAST KEEP THE ONION SOUP
sample-002473.wav,HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
sample-002474.wav,THERE WAS A THUD LIKE THE FALL OF A GREAT MASS
sample-002475.wav,AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
sample-002476.wav,WHO DO YOU FEEL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT
sample-002477.wav,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
sample-002478.wav,IT WAS A FIGHTER JET FLYING BETWEEN THE BUILDINGS
sample-002479.wav,KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON
sample-002480.wav,THE POLICE FINALLY MANAGE TO GET HIM OUT OF THE PARK
sample-002481.wav,SOMEBODY PUSHED AGAINST ME AND I ALMOST FELL INTO THE DITCH
sample-002482.wav,SO WHAT IS SALEM LIKE HE ASKED TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF CLUE
sample-002483.wav,FROM THEN ON THE BOY UNDERSTOOD HIS HEART
sample-002484.wav,THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
sample-002485.wav,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sample-002486.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sample-002487.wav,MY FATHER FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
sample-002488.wav,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
sample-002489.wav,I COULDN'T WORK IN THE CITY
sample-002490.wav,HE JUST TOOK OVER THE BANK
sample-002491.wav,HE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AND WAS SURE THAT SHE HAD PROBABLY MARRIED
sample-002492.wav,IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sample-002493.wav,BUT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS EXULTANT
sample-002494.wav,THERE MUST BE A LANGUAGE THAT DOESN'T DEPEND ON WORDS THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-002495.wav,THE ACTOR'S AUTHENTIC FACIAL EXPRESSION WAS CONVINCING THE JURY
sample-002496.wav,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sample-002497.wav,BY ENUMERATING THE PEOPLE SHE WANTED TO TALK WITH SHE WAS CALMED
sample-002498.wav,THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
sample-002499.wav,AND GOT IT OUT AS SOON AS YOU CAN
sample-002500.wav,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sample-002501.wav,THE BOY PROMISED HIMSELF THAT WHEN HE RETURNED FROM EGYPT HE WOULD BUY THAT SWORD
sample-002502.wav,I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRANSMITTED BY WORD OF MOUTH HE THOUGHT
sample-002503.wav,AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
sample-002504.wav,IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE
sample-002505.wav,BUT BAKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERDS
sample-002506.wav,BUT YOU WILL LOVE HER AND SHE'LL RETURN YOUR LOVE
sample-002507.wav,IT SHOULD PROVIDED RESULTS COMPARABLE TO THE STATE OF THE ART
sample-002508.wav,THERE WAS NO NEED TO IMPRISON THEM THE ARABS SIMPLY CONFISCATED THEIR HORSES
sample-002509.wav,WHAT WE NEED IS FIREWORKS
sample-002510.wav,CAN I GO NOW
sample-002511.wav,TWINS ARE KNOWN TO BE CONFOUNDING
sample-002512.wav,IT SEEMED AS IF WHAT THE OLD KING HAD CALLED BEGINNER'S LUCK WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING
sample-002513.wav,AS JENNIFER WALKED DOWN THE AISLE SHE WONDERED IF SHE HAD MADE A MISTAKE
sample-002514.wav,WHAT ARE YOU DOING AROUND HERE
sample-002515.wav,I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sample-002516.wav,IT DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO THE BOY TO FLEE
sample-002517.wav,THIS MORNING I FOUND A CALCULATOR TAPED TO MY WII
sample-002518.wav,THE BOY'S NAME WAS SANTIAGO
sample-002519.wav,WELL WHY DON'T YOU GO TO MECCA NOW ASKED THE BOY
sample-002520.wav,ALL THIS HAPPENED BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-002521.wav,OF COURSE IT IS
sample-002522.wav,AND HERE'S A KISS FOR YOU
sample-002523.wav,IN ORDER TO FIND THE TREASURE YOU WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THE OMENS
sample-002524.wav,DO IT FOR THE PAPER
sample-002525.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sample-002526.wav,THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
sample-002527.wav,THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SO DID THE BOY
sample-002528.wav,I CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-002529.wav,IT RATTLED MENACINGLY
sample-002530.wav,THE OLD MAN LEAFED THROUGH THE BOOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
sample-002531.wav,I STILL SAY THAT THIS JOHN DOE PERSON IS A MYTH
sample-002532.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT
sample-002533.wav,I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-002534.wav,SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLING OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
sample-002535.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
sample-002536.wav,I WANT THEM BOTH ARRESTED
sample-002537.wav,HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE DIDN'T
sample-002538.wav,NOT UNTIL THE MOON WAS HIGH DID THE ALCHEMIST RIDE INTO VIEW
sample-002539.wav,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sample-002540.wav,I CAN'T THINK OF ANY REASON WHY SHE WAS KILLED
sample-002541.wav,MY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PROMS
sample-002542.wav,THE WEATHER FORECAST FOR THIS WEEK DIDN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL
sample-002543.wav,YOU HAVE HELPED ME THE MAN CONTINUED TO PREPARE HIS TEA SAYING NOTHING
sample-002544.wav,TODAY'S WORLD IS FULL OF COMMERCIALS
sample-002545.wav,WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT
sample-002546.wav,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
sample-002547.wav,HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sample-002548.wav,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
sample-002549.wav,UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
sample-002550.wav,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sample-002551.wav,THEY WERE KNOWN AS SEERS AND THEY WERE HELD IN FEAR BY WOMEN AND THE ELDERLY
sample-002552.wav,THE SNOW BLASTED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
sample-002553.wav,A LITTLE LEMONGRASS SHOULD FRESHEN IT UP
sample-002554.wav,AS WAS MECCA FOR THE MERCHANT
sample-002555.wav,THERE WAS A SMALL BUILDING THERE WITH A WINDOW AT WHICH PEOPLE BOUGHT TICKETS TO AFRICA
sample-002556.wav,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ONE OF THE FIGURES DEMANDED
sample-002557.wav,ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS MUST HAVE BEEN GETTING READY
sample-002558.wav,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
sample-002559.wav,THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sample-002560.wav,BEFORE GUNS WERE INVENTED ARMIES HAD TO THROW BULLETS AT EACH OTHER AND IF A BULLET TOUCHED YOU YOU HAD TO SIT OUT UNTIL THE NEXT WAR
sample-002561.wav,THIS ISN'T A KIDNAPPING
sample-002562.wav,I HATE TO THINK THAT I WILL HAVE TO LEAVE BUT I GUESS THATS NOT REALLY UP TO ME
sample-002563.wav,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY BEGINNER'S LUCK
sample-002564.wav,IF HE WERE FED ON TIME HE WOULDN'T CRY
sample-002565.wav,I'M A DESERT WOMAN AND I'M PROUD OF THAT
sample-002566.wav,IN HIS HAND HE GRASPED A SNAKE BY THE TAIL
sample-002567.wav,I DON'T KNOW THE DESERT THAT WELL YET
sample-002568.wav,THE TRAIN LINES PROVIDED AN EASY PATH TO FOLLOW
sample-002569.wav,THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY
sample-002570.wav,HE SAW THE BOY APPEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DUNES
sample-002571.wav,WHERE ARE YOU FROM THE BOY ASKED
sample-002572.wav,YOU FORGET THE POWER THAT ALWAYS WATCHES OVER THE MORNING POST
sample-002573.wav,HAVEN'T YOU EVEN STARTED
sample-002574.wav,HE SAW THE BOY APPEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DUNES
sample-002575.wav,THIS MAKES ME FEEL FUNNY
sample-002576.wav,A LITTLE COLLEGE GIRL FROM A SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM
sample-002577.wav,LIKE EATING OR SLEEPING OR LIKE SEEKING LOVE OR FINDING A JOB
sample-002578.wav,AND HE GETS IT RIGHT AWAY
sample-002579.wav,THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
sample-002580.wav,WHAT'S SO DEPRESSING ABOUT THAT
sample-002581.wav,THE WOMAN SAT DOWN AND TOLD HIM TO BE SEATED AS WELL
sample-002582.wav,ITS SATURDAY ITS HOT AND I REALLY WANT TO TRY THE DRY RAMEN
sample-002583.wav,I AM UPSET THAT THEY GET TO HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD WHILE ACTING LIKE THEY EARNED IT
sample-002584.wav,A BREEZE BEGAN TO BLOW
sample-002585.wav,YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE IN A LOVING WAY AND DIED WITH DIGNITY
sample-002586.wav,SEVERAL FIGURES APPROACHED HIM
sample-002587.wav,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
sample-002588.wav,BUT HE KEPT QUIET BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD WHAT THE ALCHEMIST SAID TO THE MONK
sample-002589.wav,BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sample-002590.wav,THE THIEF WASN'T THERE AND THE OWNER BROUGHT HIM A CUP OF TEA
sample-002591.wav,HE'S AFTER THE MONEY
sample-002592.wav,CAUSE YOU KNOW HOW POLITICIANS ARE
sample-002593.wav,IS THAT ANY GOOD
sample-002594.wav,A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT SEVERAL LANGUAGES WERE SPOKEN IN THE SHOP
sample-002595.wav,THE CROWD SWAYED A LITTLE AS I ELBOWED MY WAY THROUGH
sample-002596.wav,DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND FRENCH
sample-002597.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-002598.wav,CATHERINE WALKED ALONGSIDE THE CANAL
sample-002599.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
sample-002600.wav,THE REST OF YOU GET IN HERE AND RIOT
sample-002601.wav,THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sample-002602.wav,THE HORIZON WAS TINGED WITH RED AND SUDDENLY THE SUN APPEARED
sample-002603.wav,IN ORDER TO FIND THE TREASURE YOU WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THE OMENS
sample-002604.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-002605.wav,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sample-002606.wav,THE SNAKE FOUGHT FRANTICALLY MAKING HISSING SOUNDS THAT SHATTERED THE SILENCE OF THE DESERT
sample-002607.wav,BUT NOW THE SOUNDS INSIDE HAD STOPPED
sample-002608.wav,MORE GOOD LUCK TELEGRAMS
sample-002609.wav,ONLY IT'LL BE A LOT EASIER WITH YOU
sample-002610.wav,AND HE GAVE THE BOY HIS BLESSING
sample-002611.wav,IT WAS THE OLD MAN WHO SPOKE FIRST
sample-002612.wav,AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
sample-002613.wav,THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT
sample-002614.wav,AND IT KNEW NOTHING ABOUT LOVE
sample-002615.wav,I'M GOING TO THEM
sample-002616.wav,THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
sample-002617.wav,THEY WERE ALL FURIOUS WHEN THE ESCAPADE FAILED
sample-002618.wav,ISN'T IT ALL TOO WONDERFUL
sample-002619.wav,HE'S TRYING TO TRICK YOU AGAIN
sample-002620.wav,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
sample-002621.wav,BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
sample-002622.wav,COULD HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY TO OLD DOC BROWN
sample-002623.wav,FEAR IS OFTEN THE CAUSE OF VIOLENCE
sample-002624.wav,WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING
sample-002625.wav,FELLER RUNS THE FEBRUARY MONTHS
sample-002626.wav,HERE I AM BETWEEN MY FLOCK AND MY TREASURE THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-002627.wav,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sample-002628.wav,THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
sample-002629.wav,THAT DAY THE MERCHANT GAVE THE BOY PERMISSION TO BUILD THE DISPLAY
sample-002630.wav,DID YOU KNOW THAT KEVIN MARCUS IS BACK FROM SCHOOL
sample-002631.wav,THIS IS THE FIRST PHASE OF THE JOB HE SAID
sample-002632.wav,NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND
sample-002633.wav,THE SPACE QUICKLY FILLED WITH PEOPLE
sample-002634.wav,WERE THEY QUICK OR WERE THEY ENRAGED
sample-002635.wav,HE WAS SELLING BETTER THAN EVER
sample-002636.wav,AS HE LOOKED AT THE STONES HE FELT RELIEVED FOR SOME REASON
sample-002637.wav,MAYBE BECAUSE THAT WASN'T REALLY HIS DREAM
sample-002638.wav,IN HIS HAND HE GRASPED A SNAKE BY THE TAIL
sample-002639.wav,BUT THE BOY WAS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THEM
sample-002640.wav,WE'VE STILL GOT TWO BUCKS LEFT
sample-002641.wav,WHEN YOU START TO EAT LIKE THIS SOMETHING IS THE MATTER
sample-002642.wav,IT WAS BUNCHED UP AND HE HAD HARDLY THOUGHT OF IT FOR A LONG TIME
sample-002643.wav,WE'LL HAVE TO SATISFY THEM
sample-002644.wav,HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
sample-002645.wav,IS THE HEAD BETTER
sample-002646.wav,THE SHEPHERD SWORE THAT HE WOULD
sample-002647.wav,YOU CAN COUNT ON ME UNDER ONE CONDITION
sample-002648.wav,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sample-002649.wav,YOU WON'T MISS ANYTHING
sample-002650.wav,WASN'T THAT A SWELL STORY WE GAVE YOU
sample-002651.wav,AND THE SOLID PART WAS CALLED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
sample-002652.wav,GET THE GOVERNOR ON THE PHONE
sample-002653.wav,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
sample-002654.wav,THE WAR IS GOING TO END SOMEDAY THE GIRL SAID
sample-002655.wav,THERE WERE RAISED VOICESAND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON 
sample-002656.wav,IT IS UP THERE
sample-002657.wav,EVERYONE ON EARTH HAS A TREASURE THAT AWAITS HIM HIS HEART SAID
sample-002658.wav,ALL THEY WANTED WAS FOOD AND WATER
sample-002659.wav,IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES BEFORE
sample-002660.wav,IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
sample-002661.wav,BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST YOUR SAVINGS TWICE
sample-002662.wav,THIS IS CHRISTMAS EVE
sample-002663.wav,I'M GOING AWAY HE SAID
sample-002664.wav,THE ITALIAN GOT HER WORDS MIXED UP
sample-002665.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT
sample-002666.wav,IF YOU KNOW OF OTHER GAMES THAT PLAY WELL WITH HANDSFREE CONTROL PLEASE POST IN THE COMMENTS
sample-002667.wav,WHENEVER HE COULD HE SOUGHT OUT A NEW ROAD TO TRAVEL
sample-002668.wav,HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HEIGHT AS THE BOY
sample-002669.wav,THEN WHO'S THIS ONE
sample-002670.wav,HE'S RIGHT IN MY OFFICE THERE
sample-002671.wav,BUT FINALLY THE MERCHANT APPEARED AND ASKED THE BOY TO SHEAR FOUR SHEEP
sample-002672.wav,IT WAS ALMOST AS IF HER LIFE HAD BEEN DELETED
sample-002673.wav,THE NURSE WADDLED AROUND THE WARD
sample-002674.wav,EVERYTHING IN LIFE IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN NOW CLOSING THE JOURNAL HE WAS READING
sample-002675.wav,BUSINESS HAS REALLY IMPROVED HE SAID TO THE BOY AFTER THE CUSTOMER HAD LEFT
sample-002676.wav,HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID
sample-002677.wav,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-002678.wav,SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO BE WITH THE SHEEP WHO DON'T SAY ANYTHING
sample-002679.wav,THE BUILDER PLACED THE BRICK ONTO THE PLANK OF WOOD SO IT WOULD BEND INTO SHAPE
sample-002680.wav,IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
sample-002681.wav,MUST HAVE BEEN THAT JUMP IN THE COLD WATER
sample-002682.wav,I LEARNED HOW TO CARE FOR SHEEP AND I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN HOW THAT'S DONE
sample-002683.wav,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-002684.wav,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sample-002685.wav,I FEEL I OUGHT TO TAKE CARE OF HER
sample-002686.wav,SOME DO COME BACK
sample-002687.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-002688.wav,SOMETHING BRIGHT REFLECTED FROM HIS CHEST WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT THE BOY WAS MOMENTARILY BLINDED
sample-002689.wav,I THOUGHT TONIGHT I'D PUT MISS KELLY THERE
sample-002690.wav,THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
sample-002691.wav,BUT YOU WILL LOVE HER AND SHE'LL RETURN YOUR LOVE
sample-002692.wav,AS THEY MOVED ALONG THE BOY TRIED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART
sample-002693.wav,EVIDENTLY WE'RE THE FLOOR SHOW
sample-002694.wav,AND I'M AFRAID WE WANT IT BACK
sample-002695.wav,I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
sample-002696.wav,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sample-002697.wav,THE ALCHEMIST KNOCKED ON THE GATE OF THE MONASTERY
sample-002698.wav,I HAD THAT RIGHT HERE
sample-002699.wav,THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL SEE THAT AND YOU'LL BE DISMISSED FROM YOUR POSITION AS COUNSELOR
sample-002700.wav,THE BRAKE FLUID WAS LEAKING OUT ONTO THE PATH
sample-002701.wav,HER MANIPULATION FAILED
sample-002702.wav,IT WAS HOWEVER STILL SO HOT FROM ITS FLIGHT THROUGH THE AIR
sample-002703.wav,TREASON IS A BLOW THAT COMES UNEXPECTEDLY
sample-002704.wav,THAT WAS HIS WORK
sample-002705.wav,THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
sample-002706.wav,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sample-002707.wav,IT MEANS ONLY THAT THE HEART DOES WHAT IT CAN THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sample-002708.wav,THE BOY PREFERRED WINE
sample-002709.wav,HE WAS JUST AND GOOD
sample-002710.wav,THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
sample-002711.wav,BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
sample-002712.wav,WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE
sample-002713.wav,I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
sample-002714.wav,WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
sample-002715.wav,WHO'S GONNA GET HIM
sample-002716.wav,THE OTHER SON WAS A POET AND DELIGHTED ALL OF ROME WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL VERSES
sample-002717.wav,TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR DREAM SAID THE WOMAN
sample-002718.wav,SO THE WIND BLEW WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH AND THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH SAND
sample-002719.wav,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
sample-002720.wav,WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING
sample-002721.wav,HOW LONG IS IT
sample-002722.wav,THEY EAT LUNCH TOGETHER OFTEN BUT DONT REALLY TALK OUTSIDE THE OFFICE
sample-002723.wav,THE BOY SAID NOTHING
sample-002724.wav,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
sample-002725.wav,NOW LET'S SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU PROTEST
sample-002726.wav,THE GUITAR BROKE AND SHE COULDN'T PLAY ANYMORE
sample-002727.wav,THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION
sample-002728.wav,THEY ARE SO USED TO ME THAT THEY KNOW MY SCHEDULE HE MUTTERED
sample-002729.wav,I READ ONLY WHAT THE BIRDS WANTED TO TELL ME
sample-002730.wav,LISTEN TO THAT MOB
sample-002731.wav,MEN HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE WORDS OF THE WISE
sample-002732.wav,LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN
sample-002733.wav,THE CLOCK WAS SLIGHTLY ASKEW
sample-002734.wav,IT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL IF MY WEB BROWSER COULD SYNCHRONIZE ALL OF ITS PREFERENCES NOT JUST SOME
sample-002735.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING
sample-002736.wav,IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
sample-002737.wav,HE QUICKLY PULLED HIS HANDS AWAY
sample-002738.wav,C'MON OVER AND JOIN OUR PARTY
sample-002739.wav,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
sample-002740.wav,THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
sample-002741.wav,THE BOY SAID NOTHING
sample-002742.wav,IN A WEEKS TIME WE'RE GOING TO AMERICA
sample-002743.wav,THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-002744.wav,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sample-002745.wav,WHAT HAD BEEN NEXT TO HIM FIVE MINUTES AGO WAS NOW AT THE OTHER SIDE
sample-002746.wav,I NEEDED IMMEDIATE ACCESS
sample-002747.wav,I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
sample-002748.wav,DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
sample-002749.wav,HE WAS MORE CERTAIN OF IT THAN OF ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
sample-002750.wav,THREE DAYS FROM NOW HE WOULD BE WITH THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
sample-002751.wav,THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
sample-002752.wav,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
sample-002753.wav,I DIDN'T FALL IN
sample-002754.wav,I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY
sample-002755.wav,I GET THIRTY DOLLARS A WEEK
sample-002756.wav,HE STARTED TO READ THE BOOK HE HAD BOUGHT
sample-002757.wav,IT'S ALWAYS NICE IF YOU CAN LEARN SOMETHING NEW ISN'T IT
sample-002758.wav,LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING
sample-002759.wav,TAKE HOLD OF THE COVER
sample-002760.wav,HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
sample-002761.wav,MOTHER IS COMING WITH US ON THE TRAIN
sample-002762.wav,THAT'S TRUE THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-002763.wav,YOU JUST DON'T KNOW ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE
sample-002764.wav,ALWAYS HEED THE OMENS THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sample-002765.wav,THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
sample-002766.wav,A HALF A HEELOT
sample-002767.wav,TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY I MUST HAVE NO FEAR OF FAILURE
sample-002768.wav,IN ORDER TO FIND THE TREASURE YOU WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THE OMENS
sample-002769.wav,THE COMPARISON TO OTHER WORKS ON DIFFERENT DATABASES IS STILL PROBLEMATIC
sample-002770.wav,THEY ALSO BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THEY KNEW A BETTER WAY THAN OTHERS HAD
sample-002771.wav,THE BOY WAS ALSO SADDENED HIS FRIEND WAS IN PURSUIT OF HIS DESTINY
sample-002772.wav,I MYSELF HEARD NOTHING OF THAT
sample-002773.wav,SHE WOULD NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO READ
sample-002774.wav,THERE WERE THREE HUNDRED WELLS FIFTY THOUSAND DATE TREES AND INNUMERABLE COLORED TENTS SPREAD AMONG THEM
sample-002775.wav,GIMME THE RECEIVING ROOM
sample-002776.wav,HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS
sample-002777.wav,BUT IN HIS HEART HE KNEW THAT IT DID MATTER
sample-002778.wav,I WANT TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT
sample-002779.wav,THERE'S NOTHING MORE WE CAN DO TONIGHT
sample-002780.wav,THAT WAS THE LAW OF HOSPITALITY
sample-002781.wav,HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DODGES AND TRICKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS
sample-002782.wav,IT DIDN'T BRING WITH IT THE SMELL OF THE DESERT NOR THE THREAT OF MOORISH INVASION
sample-002783.wav,HE LIVES AT THE ALFAYOUM OASIS HIS FRIEND HAD SAID
sample-002784.wav,AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHEMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS
sample-002785.wav,THE SAME HAND THAT HAD BRANDISHED THE SWORD NOW HELD A WHIP
sample-002786.wav,THAT GUY OVER THERE LIKES TO DRINK A LOT TALK A LOT BUT DO NOTHING
sample-002787.wav,ANOTHER HOUR TO WRITE IT
sample-002788.wav,THIS IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION SHELDON SAID
sample-002789.wav,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sample-002790.wav,I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sample-002791.wav,I DIDN'T MEAN TO SHOOT HIM
sample-002792.wav,THE SPEECH WILL CONTINUE
sample-002793.wav,ALCHEMY IS A SERIOUS DISCIPLINE
sample-002794.wav,'AND THIS IS WHAT YOUR SON SAID' THE ANGEL TOLD THE MAN
sample-002795.wav,JUST WHAT IS THE LOWDOWN ON WILLIAMS
sample-002796.wav,IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO TALK
sample-002797.wav,HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU GONNA CALL ME
sample-002798.wav,THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
sample-002799.wav,BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
sample-002800.wav,I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS
sample-002801.wav,THIS CAN AROUSE NATIONAL INTEREST
sample-002802.wav,THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
sample-002803.wav,BUT YOU ARE IN THE DESERT
sample-002804.wav,THE PEOPLE WERE ALSO PRAYING TO HEAVEN FOR PROTECTION
sample-002805.wav,THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP
sample-002806.wav,THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sample-002807.wav,ONCE TO THE THIEF AND ONCE TO THE GENERAL
sample-002808.wav,BECAUSE OF THE OMENS THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-002809.wav,WELL WHY DID YOU SAY THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT LOVE THE SUN ASKED THE BOY
sample-002810.wav,YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
sample-002811.wav,FEBRUARY TOOK A BOOK FROM THE SHELVES
sample-002812.wav,ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE FIRST CLEAR SIGN OF DANGER APPEARED
sample-002813.wav,WHY DON'T YOU WANT ME TO SEE HIM
sample-002814.wav,IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
sample-002815.wav,THE CAT SAT ON THE FENCE
sample-002816.wav,EVERYBODY QUIET AND READY FOR AN EMERGENCY
sample-002817.wav,SPEAK TO THE HAND THAT WROTE ALL SAID THE SUN
sample-002818.wav,AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
sample-002819.wav,BUT BAKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERDS
sample-002820.wav,HAVE A GOOD TRIP
sample-002821.wav,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sample-002822.wav,FATIMA WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS TREASURE
sample-002823.wav,I MAKE MY LIVING FORECASTING THE FUTURE FOR PEOPLE HE SAID
sample-002824.wav,I'M GOING AWAY HE SAID
sample-002825.wav,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sample-002826.wav,IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE
sample-002827.wav,THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO JUST ANYONE
sample-002828.wav,IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
sample-002829.wav,TEN YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY AND HERE I AM IN A CORRAL
sample-002830.wav,THE WHOLE TOWN'S IN AN UPROAR
sample-002831.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN ASKED IF THEY WERE IN DANGER
sample-002832.wav,THE REFERENCES ARE GOOD IN THE VERY NARROW AREA OF HISTOGRAM METHODS
sample-002833.wav,IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIEDUP LAKES
sample-002834.wav,HE WAS PLANNING AS HE LEFT THE BAR
sample-002835.wav,IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
sample-002836.wav,BUT NOWHERE COULD HE FIND HIS NEW COMPANION
sample-002837.wav,THE WHOLE CREATURE HEAVED AND PULSATED CONVULSIVELY
sample-002838.wav,IF YOU KNOW YOUR HEART WELL IT WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO THAT TO YOU
sample-002839.wav,BUT THERE WAS A SIXTH DAY THE SUN WENT ON
sample-002840.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sample-002841.wav,TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR DREAM SAID THE WOMAN
sample-002842.wav,THAT'S THE POINT AT WHICH MOST PEOPLE GIVE UP
sample-002843.wav,I HAVE TO SEPARATE OUT THE SULFUR
sample-002844.wav,THIS IS A TRICK TO GET YOUR SYMPATHY
sample-002845.wav,JUST AS YOUR GRANDFATHER TAUGHT YOU
sample-002846.wav,BECAUSE OF THE OMENS THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-002847.wav,SOME DO COME BACK
sample-002848.wav,WHAT DOES THAT GET US
sample-002849.wav,THAT WAS THE LAW OF HOSPITALITY
sample-002850.wav,THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE BOY DUG AT THE PLACE HE HAD CHOSEN BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-002851.wav,ONLY WHEN HE HIMSELF REVEALS IT
sample-002852.wav,IT'S EASY AND YET I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE HE THOUGHT
sample-002853.wav,NOW I TOO WILL BE ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO WAIT
sample-002854.wav,AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
sample-002855.wav,AND YOU CAN MEET US AT THE STATION
sample-002856.wav,HE LISTENED TO THE WIND AND FELT THE STONES BENEATH HIS FEET
sample-002857.wav,THERE THE ALCHEMIST SEPARATED THE DISK INTO FOUR PARTS
sample-002858.wav,I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
sample-002859.wav,AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
sample-002860.wav,FIRST THEY TRIED TO FIND HIM ON THEIR OWN
sample-002861.wav,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
sample-002862.wav,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sample-002863.wav,MAYBE BECAUSE THAT WASN'T REALLY HIS DREAM
sample-002864.wav,I AM PROUD OF YOU HE SAID
sample-002865.wav,HE SAID THAT EVERYTHING HAS ITS OWN DESTINY
sample-002866.wav,DENSE CLOUDS OF SMOKE OR DUST CAN BE SEEN THROUGH A POWERFUL TELESCOPE
sample-002867.wav,THAT'S GOOD THOUGHT THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-002868.wav,EVERYWHERE THERE WERE STALLS WITH ITEMS FOR SALE
sample-002869.wav,ARE YOU GOING TO GO TO JULIA'S
sample-002870.wav,DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
sample-002871.wav,I THINK IT'S MARVELOUS
sample-002872.wav,THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS
sample-002873.wav,BUT AS HE SAW THEM LYING THERE ON THE GROUND ANOTHER PHRASE CAME TO HIS MIND
sample-002874.wav,THE LEAD HAD DRIED INTO THE SHAPE OF THE PAN BUT IT WAS NO LONGER LEAD
sample-002875.wav,YOU MUST LOVE THE DESERT BUT NEVER TRUST IT COMPLETELY
sample-002876.wav,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
sample-002877.wav,ONLY WHEN HE HIMSELF REVEALS IT
sample-002878.wav,I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND
sample-002879.wav,BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GO INTO BATTLE
sample-002880.wav,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-002881.wav,NOW HIS INTUITION WAS THAT HE HAD BEEN RIGHT IN COMING
sample-002882.wav,IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT FELL TO EARTH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILES EAST OF HERE
sample-002883.wav,EVENTUALLY THE MERCHANT HAD TO HIRE TWO MORE EMPLOYEES
sample-002884.wav,LOOK AROUND SOME TIME
sample-002885.wav,THE PEAK OF THIS MOUNTAIN IS OVER TWO THOUSAND METERS ABOVE SEA LEVEL
sample-002886.wav,THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD
sample-002887.wav,THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE

sample-003182.wav,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sample-003183.wav,BECAUSE FOR HIM YOU ARE A GREEN FIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME
sample-003184.wav,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
sample-003185.wav,AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS

sample-003204.wav,THEY HAVE CHEAP SAUSAGES AND FRIES AT THE BREWERY TOMORROW
sample-003205.wav,I WAS DISAPPOINTED AT THIS INANIMATE BULK
sample-003206.wav,I DON'T BLAME HIM
sample-003207.wav,WELL THEN HELP ME DO THAT THE BOY SAID
sample-003208.wav,ABOUT AN HOUR AGO
sample-003209.wav,THERE WERE REALLY I THINK TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ELBOWING ONE ANOTHER
sample-003210.wav,THE BOY TOOK OUT URIM AND THUMMIM FROM HIS BAG
sample-003211.wav,THE CUSHION WAS SOFT AND INVITING
sample-003212.wav,THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE MISTAKEN
sample-003213.wav,THEY FORGOT THAT LEAD COPPER AND IRON HAVE THEIR OWN DESTINIES TO FULFILL
sample-003214.wav,IT WAS THE FIRST TIME EITHER HAD TOUCHED THE OTHER
sample-003215.wav,IT WASN'T MUCH ANYWAY
sample-003216.wav,THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-003217.wav,UNLIKE VOICECODE WHICH IS A COMPLETE SOLUTION DRAGONFLY IS JUST AN IMPROVED PYTHON API TO DRAGON
sample-003218.wav,SOMEPLACE YOU COULD HAVE PUT IT
sample-003219.wav,I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID
sample-003220.wav,DON'T MIND THE COLONEL
sample-003221.wav,ONE IS LOVED BECAUSE ONE IS LOVED
sample-003222.wav,BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WON'T BE FIXED UNTIL THE CONSUMER VERSION WHICH DOESN'T HAVE A RELEASE DATE YET
sample-003223.wav,THE LONDONERS REGRETTED VISITING THIS AWFUL PLACE
sample-003224.wav,ON THE VERY FIRST PAGE IT DESCRIBED A BURIAL CEREMONY
sample-003225.wav,HE DIDN'T KNOW THE MAN YET BUT HIS PRACTICED EYE WOULD RECOGNIZE HIM WHEN HE APPEARED
sample-003226.wav,A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sample-003227.wav,I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY
sample-003228.wav,WE ARE OBLIGED AT LEAST ONCE IN OUR LIVES TO VISIT THE HOLY CITY OF MECCA
sample-003229.wav,THE BOY WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT HIS FRIEND HAD SIMPLY BECOME SEPARATED FROM HIM BY ACCIDENT
sample-003230.wav,NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-003231.wav,THE BOY WAS STARTLED
sample-003232.wav,THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
sample-003233.wav,HE STOOD SILENT AND MOTIONLESS REGARDING ME
sample-003234.wav,I'M BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT
sample-003235.wav,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
sample-003236.wav,IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
sample-003237.wav,VICKY WANTED TO NOT MAKE A SPECTACLE OF HERSELF
sample-003238.wav,HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
sample-003239.wav,BUT I FELT MISERABLE WATCHING HIM WITHER AWAY LIKE A SHRIVELED DANDELION
sample-003240.wav,YOU ALREADY KNOW ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
sample-003241.wav,YOU CAN HEAR OUT OF IT
sample-003242.wav,SHE AND THE JUDGE ARE LIKE CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE
sample-003243.wav,WE'VE DONE IT SAID THE ENGLISHMAN WHO HAD ALSO AWAKENED EARLY
sample-003244.wav,HE FELT UNSAFE LIKE DURING HIS FIRST LESSON IN DRIVING SCHOOL
sample-003245.wav,I'M GOING TO NEED IT
sample-003246.wav,THE YOUNG ARAB TOOK OUT A BOOK AND BEGAN TO READ
sample-003247.wav,THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
sample-003248.wav,MY SEVEN YEAR RESUME GAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
sample-003249.wav,ON RAINY DAYS I WILL PLAY INSIDE
sample-003250.wav,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
sample-003251.wav,THE PEOPLE WERE ALSO PRAYING TO HEAVEN FOR PROTECTION
sample-003252.wav,THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
sample-003253.wav,THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
sample-003254.wav,I'LL TALK TO YOU TONIGHT
sample-003255.wav,BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUMNI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS
sample-003256.wav,ANOTHER RUN ON THE BANK
sample-003257.wav,THOSE ARE THE RULES OF WAR THE LEADER EXPLAINED
sample-003258.wav,TRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU'RE IN THE DESERT
sample-003259.wav,WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
sample-003260.wav,MEANWHILE THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT HIS TREASURE
sample-003261.wav,AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
sample-003262.wav,STORM INCREASING OVER THE ROCKIES
sample-003263.wav,DON'T BE IMPATIENT HE REPEATED TO HIMSELF
sample-003264.wav,SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sample-003265.wav,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sample-003266.wav,HER OLD MAN WAS DOC MITCHELL
sample-003267.wav,I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE ME THERE IF YOU CAN
sample-003268.wav,THE OASIS IS NEUTRAL GROUND
sample-003269.wav,HE PREPARED HIMSELF A SANDWICH AND DRANK SOME HOT TEA FROM A CRYSTAL GLASS
sample-003270.wav,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
sample-003271.wav,IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT MONEY CAN SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE
sample-003272.wav,THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES AND RODE OUT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT
sample-003273.wav,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
sample-003274.wav,TO STUFF INTO THEIR OWN POCKETS
sample-003275.wav,I DON'T THINK I FOLLOW YOU
sample-003276.wav,CAN I GET A WOOT WOOT
sample-003277.wav,I'LL JUST WATCH HIM HE SAID TO HIMSELF
sample-003278.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
sample-003279.wav,AS THE ENGLISHMAN LEFT FATIMA ARRIVED AND FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER
sample-003280.wav,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
sample-003281.wav,THE RECTANGLE WAS PARALLEL TO THE SQUARE
sample-003282.wav,I FEEL SO GOOD I COULD SPIT
sample-003283.wav,COVER UP THAT TRANSMITTER
sample-003284.wav,TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM
sample-003285.wav,THAT DOESN'T SAY MUCH FOR MINE
sample-003286.wav,HE'S LOOKING FOR YOU
sample-003287.wav,ELLIE WON FIRST PRIZE IN THE SPELLING COMPETITION
sample-003288.wav,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sample-003289.wav,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
sample-003290.wav,NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CANDIDATES
sample-003291.wav,WOULD YOU LIKE A CAPPUCCINO
sample-003292.wav,HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD
sample-003293.wav,MANY TELESCOPES WERE POINTED AT IT
sample-003294.wav,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED A FLASH OF FIRE
sample-003295.wav,LIKE EVERYBODY LEARNS HE SAID
sample-003296.wav,THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS OGILVY AND HENDERSON HAD LEFT IT
sample-003297.wav,THE FINE MANUFACTURING COMPANY WAS A BOOKKEEPER FOR FOURTEEN YEARS
sample-003298.wav,HE WAS DRESSED ONLY IN HIS PAJAMAS
sample-003299.wav,WHAT TIME IS IT
sample-003300.wav,THE HORSEMAN WAS COMPLETELY IMMOBILE AS WAS THE BOY
sample-003301.wav,AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE WERE PASSING MY SHOP ALL THE TIME HEADING FOR MECCA
sample-003302.wav,YOU CAN ONLY SPIT OUT SO MANY SEEDS
sample-003303.wav,A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL WITH A LOUD AND SHARP NOISE
sample-003304.wav,TOFFEE COATED ALL THE SURFACES IT WAS DISGUSTINGLY STICKY
sample-003305.wav,SOMEBODY HAD RETURNED MY LOST CREDIT CARD TO THE BANK
sample-003306.wav,AND THE FALCON THEN NOURISHES MAN
sample-003307.wav,YOU CAME SO THAT YOU COULD LEARN ABOUT YOUR DREAMS SAID THE OLD WOMAN
sample-003308.wav,DID YOU SEE HIS PICTURE ON THE COVER OF TIME
sample-003309.wav,IN ONE HE HAD READ THAT MANY YEARS AGO A FAMOUS ARABIAN ALCHEMIST HAD VISITED EUROPE
sample-003310.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN'S EYES LIT UP
sample-003311.wav,I HOPE IT WORKS
sample-003312.wav,THEY STOOD THERE LOOKING AT THE MOON
sample-003313.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER THOUGH SEEMED NOT TO BE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE THREAT OF WAR
sample-003314.wav,IT'S TOO BAD THAT HE'S QUICKLY GOING TO FORGET MY NAME HE THOUGHT
sample-003315.wav,THE WAR CONTINUED AND AT TIMES THE WIND CARRIED THE SWEET SICKLY SMELL OF BLOOD
sample-003316.wav,I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
sample-003317.wav,THE FACT THAT THE TWO HOURS HAD STRETCHED INTO AN ENTIRE YEAR DIDN'T MATTER
sample-003318.wav,NOW HE WAS HERE NOT WITH HIS FLOCK BUT WITH A SHOVEL
sample-003319.wav,HE HOPED THAT IT WOULD BE SOMEONE AS CAPABLE AS HIS PREVIOUS APPRENTICE
sample-003320.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN ASKED IF THEY WERE IN DANGER
sample-003321.wav,I KNOW VERY WELL WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
sample-003322.wav,THE CAMEL DRIVER WAS NOT A FIGHTER AND HE HAD CONSULTED WITH SEERS
sample-003323.wav,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sample-003324.wav,EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY THE SAME HAND
sample-003325.wav,FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
sample-003326.wav,DOES SHE HAVE THE MONEY
sample-003327.wav,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sample-003328.wav,WE NEED TO RUN
sample-003329.wav,HE WAS SELLING BETTER THAN EVER
sample-003330.wav,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
sample-003331.wav,YOU CAN'T BE THE WIND THE WIND SAID
sample-003332.wav,THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE SO PROFOUND THAT IT SEEMED THE CITY WAS ASLEEP
sample-003333.wav,I'M GOING TO PUT HER THROUGH COLLEGE
sample-003334.wav,YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sample-003335.wav,YOU CAN TRY USING AN EYE TRACKER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BUT THE PRECISION ISN'T QUITE HIGH ENOUGH
sample-003336.wav,YOU HAVE ENOUGH GOLD TO BUY MANY SHEEP AND MANY CAMELS
sample-003337.wav,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sample-003338.wav,HIS NAME IS WELCH
sample-003339.wav,ENOUGH SAID THE BOY
sample-003340.wav,HE'S TRYING TO TRICK YOU AGAIN
sample-003341.wav,I TOLD HIM WE COULD TEACH HER TO IGNORE PEOPLE WHO WASTE HER TIME
sample-003342.wav,THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
sample-003343.wav,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
sample-003344.wav,ONE MUST PREPARE FOR IT
sample-003345.wav,BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
sample-003346.wav,FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
sample-003347.wav,WHY SHOULDN'T I MAKE FATHER MY BENEFICIARY
sample-003348.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-003349.wav,WHAT'S SHE UP TO
sample-003350.wav,THESE ARE THE SPIES SAID ONE OF THE MEN
sample-003351.wav,IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS THAT HE COVERED IN AN HOUR
sample-003352.wav,AS FAST AS I CAN
sample-003353.wav,YOUR OFFICE TELEPHONED ME TO HOLD HIM
sample-003354.wav,HE PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR AND THEY WENT TO A SMALL CAFE NEARBY
sample-003355.wav,THE BOY LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OVENS AND OTHER APPARATUS USED IN ALCHEMY BUT SAW NONE
sample-003356.wav,THERE WERE RAISED VOICESAND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON 
sample-003357.wav,THE CROW TILTED ITS HEAD AS IF IT WAS THINKING
sample-003358.wav,EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
sample-003359.wav,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
sample-003360.wav,AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sample-003361.wav,BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sample-003362.wav,AND ABOUT YOU TOO
sample-003363.wav,IT WAS STARLIGHT AND I EXPLAINED THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC TO HER
sample-003364.wav,AMERICANS LOVE TO HAVE A BARBECUE
sample-003365.wav,TURKEY FOR THANKSGIVING
sample-003366.wav,THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sample-003367.wav,FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
sample-003368.wav,ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
sample-003369.wav,THE BOY WAS RELIEVED
sample-003370.wav,IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sample-003371.wav,MR NELSON COME YET
sample-003372.wav,AND THEN THEY WANT THE PERSON TO CHANGE
sample-003373.wav,THEY ARE CALLED PRIVATE AND PUBLIC KEY
sample-003374.wav,WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME THE BOY ASKED
sample-003375.wav,WE'LL SAVE THEM FOR SEED
sample-003376.wav,NOTE THAT THE EMACS EXTENSION ACE JUMP MODE WORKS SIMILARLY TO THIS
sample-003377.wav,WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED THAT
sample-003378.wav,NEVER STOP DREAMING THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sample-003379.wav,THE SHEEP WILL GET USED TO MY NOT BEING THERE TOO THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-003380.wav,HE APPEARED WITH THE FIRST STARS OF EVENING
sample-003381.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sample-003382.wav,I THOUGHT I'D BUY THEM SOME GROCERIES
sample-003383.wav,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
sample-003384.wav,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sample-003385.wav,AND HE VANISHED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE PLAZA
sample-003386.wav,AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sample-003387.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sample-003388.wav,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sample-003389.wav,THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP
sample-003390.wav,IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
sample-003391.wav,WHY DO THEY NEED GIN
sample-003392.wav,I LEFT MY FATHER MY MOTHER AND THE TOWN CASTLE BEHIND
sample-003393.wav,BEFORE THE SUN HAD REACHED ITS HIGH POINT FIVE HUNDRED TRIBESMEN APPEARED ON THE HORIZON
sample-003394.wav,THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON METEORITES STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
sample-003395.wav,IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
sample-003396.wav,HE DECIDED TO STAY RIGHT THERE AND AWAIT HIS RETURN
sample-003397.wav,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-003398.wav,TOWARD THE END OF THE AFTERNOON THEY CAME UPON A COPTIC MONASTERY
sample-003399.wav,I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE
sample-003400.wav,TAKING THE FERRY WAS A WISE CHOICE
sample-003401.wav,THEY'RE NOT WORTH MUCH THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED
sample-003402.wav,THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sample-003403.wav,FATIMA APPEARED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TENT
sample-003404.wav,CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT
sample-003405.wav,SOMEWHERE YOU ARE HOLDING THE PERSON I LOVE THE BOY SAID
sample-003406.wav,THE BOY REMEMBERED AN OLD PROVERB FROM HIS COUNTRY
sample-003407.wav,SHE TOOK CARE OF BOBBY FOR US
sample-003408.wav,I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU ALL MORNING HE SAID AS HE LED THE BOY OUTSIDE
sample-003409.wav,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sample-003410.wav,THE BOY THANKED HIM ATE IT AND WENT ON HIS WAY
sample-003411.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sample-003412.wav,THEY REPRESENT MILLIONS OF VOTERS
sample-003413.wav,HAVE LIV CALL ME IN THE RESTAURANT IN TWENTY MINUTES
sample-003414.wav,PUT DOWN THAT CHAIR
sample-003415.wav,ONLY WHEN HE CONSENTS
sample-003416.wav,SHE FELT LIKE A WEAKLING IN COMPARISON TO HER NEWBORN DAUGHTER
sample-003417.wav,CATHERINE WALKED ALONGSIDE THE CANAL
sample-003418.wav,ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
sample-003419.wav,WHO'S THE TEN FOR
sample-003420.wav,I CAN'T THINK ANY MORE
sample-003421.wav,MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY THAN THE PYRAMIDS
sample-003422.wav,BUT BEFORE I GO I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY
sample-003423.wav,AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
sample-003424.wav,THE BOY WAS EMBARRASSED AND CONFESSED THAT HE HAD OBSERVED NOTHING
sample-003425.wav,LEANNE JOINED A CHOIR SO EVERYONE COULD HEAR HER SUBLIME SINGING VOICE
sample-003426.wav,WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED HE ASKED THE ENGLISHMAN ONE NIGHT
sample-003427.wav,DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON
sample-003428.wav,WHY DON'T WE SEARCH THEIR ROOMS
sample-003429.wav,THE BOY KNEW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CITY
sample-003430.wav,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
sample-003431.wav,HE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE SHEEP WERE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAID
sample-003432.wav,HE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AND WAS SURE THAT SHE HAD PROBABLY MARRIED
sample-003433.wav,BUT I'M GOING TO EGYPT THE BOY SAID
sample-003434.wav,THE EXPERIMENTS ARE UNCONVINCING
sample-003435.wav,HE PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR AND THEY WENT TO A SMALL CAFE NEARBY
sample-003436.wav,IS IT A DEAL OR ISN'T IT
sample-003437.wav,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
sample-003438.wav,WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
sample-003439.wav,IT WAS HIS HEART THAT WOULD TELL HIM WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS HIDDEN
sample-003440.wav,I'LL TAKE MINE NOW
sample-003441.wav,THE CONCRETE WAS COVERED IN MOSS
sample-003442.wav,IT'S THE MASTER WORK OF THE ALCHEMISTS
sample-003443.wav,IT WAS MY FEAR OF FAILURE THAT FIRST KEPT ME FROM ATTEMPTING THE MASTER WORK
sample-003444.wav,I'LL SEE YOU GET IT IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
sample-003445.wav,WITH EVERY DAY THAT PASSED THE BOY'S HEART BECAME MORE AND MORE SILENT
sample-003446.wav,YOU ARE WISE BECAUSE YOU OBSERVE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE THE BOY SAID
sample-003447.wav,BUT THERE'S A TRIBAL WAR THE BOY REITERATED
sample-003448.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
sample-003449.wav,IN ANY CASE THE DESERT WAS IMPASSABLE
sample-003450.wav,BUT HE KEPT QUIET BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD WHAT THE ALCHEMIST SAID TO THE MONK
sample-003451.wav,HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE DIDN'T
sample-003452.wav,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND LIFE IN THE DESERT THE BOY SAID
sample-003453.wav,AT THAT POINT IN THEIR LIVES EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE
sample-003454.wav,YOU GOT YOUR SEA LEGS YET
sample-003455.wav,ON THE SECOND DAY THE BOY CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A CLIFF NEAR THE CAMP
sample-003456.wav,WHY'D YOU WANT TO SAVE ME
sample-003457.wav,GIVE ME THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE
sample-003458.wav,BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
sample-003459.wav,BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE AND DIDN'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY
sample-003460.wav,HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sample-003461.wav,AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY
sample-003462.wav,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sample-003463.wav,THIS IS WHY ALCHEMY EXISTS THE BOY SAID
sample-003464.wav,TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR DREAM SAID THE WOMAN
sample-003465.wav,WE MUST STAY HIDDEN
sample-003466.wav,UPON RETURNING TO THE WISE MAN HE RELATED IN DETAIL EVERYTHING HE HAD SEEN
sample-003467.wav,I'LL BE RIGHT HERE
sample-003468.wav,AND ASK FOR A GLASS OF WINE FOR ME
sample-003469.wav,THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
sample-003470.wav,BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE IN EITHER MY PAST OR MY FUTURE
sample-003471.wav,THEN SHE FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER AND LEFT
sample-003472.wav,EVERY PURCHASE IS A VOTE
sample-003473.wav,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
sample-003474.wav,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
sample-003475.wav,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
sample-003476.wav,HE WAS MORE CONFIDENT IN HIMSELF THOUGH AND FELT AS THOUGH HE COULD CONQUER THE WORLD
sample-003477.wav,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
sample-003478.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sample-003479.wav,HE'S ON THE WAY
sample-003480.wav,WATER BOARDING IS A TERRIBLE FORM OF TORTURE
sample-003481.wav,I'M GOING TO PUT HER THROUGH COLLEGE
sample-003482.wav,HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
sample-003483.wav,WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE EMERALD TABLET THE BOY WANTED TO KNOW
sample-003484.wav,HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE
sample-003485.wav,BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING
sample-003486.wav,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sample-003487.wav,HAVEN'T YOU EVEN STARTED
sample-003488.wav,YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING ALL SET
sample-003489.wav,PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
sample-003490.wav,I'M GETTING TREVOR READY
sample-003491.wav,DENNIS WAS NOT A BUSINESS MAN
sample-003492.wav,HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD
sample-003493.wav,I'LL GIVE IT A DRINK
sample-003494.wav,AT THE CAMP IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE ANYTHING
sample-003495.wav,THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
sample-003496.wav,WHAT'LL IT TAKE TILL THE BANK REOPENS
sample-003497.wav,HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
sample-003498.wav,THAT'S TOO FAR FROM THE BEDROOM
sample-003499.wav,AND THEY ATTACKED AN EMPTY TENT
sample-003500.wav,THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AND THEN IRRITATED
sample-003501.wav,WELL I'D LIKE TO SEE THEIR LAND AND SEE HOW THEY LIVE SAID HIS SON
sample-003502.wav,YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
sample-003503.wav,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sample-003504.wav,I FEEL QUITE AMBIVALENT ABOUT THE ARTICLE
sample-003505.wav,FIRST THEY TRIED TO FIND HIM ON THEIR OWN
sample-003506.wav,THE SUN WAS TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DISK
sample-003507.wav,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sample-003508.wav,THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS KNAPSACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANK SOME
sample-003509.wav,THIS IS THE MAYOR
sample-003510.wav,IT SEEMED AS IF WHAT THE OLD KING HAD CALLED BEGINNER'S LUCK WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING
sample-003511.wav,YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR ME THE LAST TIME
sample-003512.wav,I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
sample-003513.wav,EVERYTHING'S GETTING COLD AND YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU
sample-003514.wav,WE RETURNED TO THE CEMETERY
sample-003515.wav,THE LENS WAS HEAVY BUT IT HAD AN AMAZING ZOOM
sample-003516.wav,I ONLY INTERPRET DREAMS
sample-003517.wav,THE BOY AWOKE AS THE SUN ROSE
sample-003518.wav,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sample-003519.wav,BETTER BRING ME A GLASS OF MILK
sample-003520.wav,WE SHOWED UP AND GAVE  MINUTE SPEECHES EACH
sample-003521.wav,THE BOY WAS ALSO SADDENED HIS FRIEND WAS IN PURSUIT OF HIS DESTINY
sample-003522.wav,ITS SATURDAY ITS HOT AND I REALLY WANT TO TRY THE DRY RAMEN
sample-003523.wav,AN ELEPHANT ON THE ROOF IS SOON AN ELEPHANT IN THE HOUSE
sample-003524.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
sample-003525.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
sample-003526.wav,HE HAS OTHER THINGS TO DO FIRST
sample-003527.wav,HE PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR AND THEY WENT TO A SMALL CAFE NEARBY
sample-003528.wav,DONT SHARE YOUR OPINIONS SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS LISTENING
sample-003529.wav,I HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
sample-003530.wav,AS FAST AS I CAN
sample-003531.wav,NOW I CAN SEE THAT IT HASN'T BEEN TOO BAD
sample-003532.wav,IT MAY BE THE GASES OF THE FIRING THAT CAUSED THE MARTIANS INCONVENIENCE
sample-003533.wav,THEY LOCKED THEMSELVES IN THEIR LABORATORIES AND TRIED TO EVOLVE AS GOLD HAD
sample-003534.wav,WE BEAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON THAT STORY
sample-003535.wav,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sample-003536.wav,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
sample-003537.wav,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
sample-003538.wav,NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECKPOINTS
sample-003539.wav,I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
sample-003540.wav,BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sample-003541.wav,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
sample-003542.wav,THE HEATHER WAS ON FIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sample-003543.wav,IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE
sample-003544.wav,THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS
sample-003545.wav,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
sample-003546.wav,COMING DOWN THE BLOCK IS THE BIGGEST STEAMROLLER I HAVE EVER SEEN
sample-003547.wav,BUT ONLY SPEAK A WORD AND MY SERVANT WILL BE HEALED
sample-003548.wav,WHEN I HAD MY SHEEP I WAS HAPPY AND I MADE THOSE AROUND ME HAPPY
sample-003549.wav,I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE APPEARANCE OF THAT COLOSSAL BULK WHICH WAS EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND
sample-003550.wav,AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sample-003551.wav,I'M GOING TO BUILD A BRIDGE A MILE LONG
sample-003552.wav,AND BETTER STILL TO BE ALONE WITH ONE'S BOOKS
sample-003553.wav,HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
sample-003554.wav,IT'S CRAWLING WITH COPS OUTSIDE
sample-003555.wav,BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
sample-003556.wav,SOME STORMS ARE WORTH THE WRECKAGE
sample-003557.wav,I REMEMBER GRANDPA PAUL LOOKING THROUGH IT
sample-003558.wav,GET MARTIN OUT OF JAIL
sample-003559.wav,I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL BE ABLE TO FIND LIFE IN THE DESERT THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-003560.wav,AND I'M SORRY TO SAY THAT THE CONGESTION IS INCREASING
sample-003561.wav,WELL THEN WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM
sample-003562.wav,WE DONT WANT HIM
sample-003563.wav,MAKES ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR
sample-003564.wav,ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sample-003565.wav,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-003566.wav,DON'T SAY ANYTHING FATIMA INTERRUPTED
sample-003567.wav,TEN YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY AND HERE I AM IN A CORRAL
sample-003568.wav,I'M A WOMAN OF THE DESERT SHE SAID AVERTING HER FACE
sample-003569.wav,I COULDNT STOP STARING AT IT
sample-003570.wav,I ADMIT THAT I'M AN ALCOHOLIC
sample-003571.wav,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-003572.wav,THAT FIRST DAY EVERYONE SLEPT FROM EXHAUSTION INCLUDING THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-003573.wav,HE LISTENED TO THE WIND AND FELT THE STONES BENEATH HIS FEET
sample-003574.wav,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-003575.wav,UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
sample-003576.wav,NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME
sample-003577.wav,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sample-003578.wav,IT DOESN'T HAVE TO RHYME
sample-003579.wav,HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
sample-003580.wav,I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
sample-003581.wav,YOU CAN VERIFY AND RERECORD YOUR OWN RECORDINGS BEFORE SUBMITTING THEM
sample-003582.wav,THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
sample-003583.wav,BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST YOUR SAVINGS TWICE
sample-003584.wav,WE KNOW THAT AND WE ARE USED TO IT
sample-003585.wav,THAT MAKES SENSE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-003586.wav,I WISH YOU EVERY POSSIBLE HAPPINESS AND JOY
sample-003587.wav,REST WELL TONIGHT AS IF YOU WERE A WARRIOR PREPARING FOR COMBAT
sample-003588.wav,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY BEGINNER'S LUCK
sample-003589.wav,WE WERE ALL MADE BY THE SAME HAND AND WE HAVE THE SAME SOUL
sample-003590.wav,ALL THINGS ARE ONE THE OLD MAN HAD SAID
sample-003591.wav,YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT LOVE NEVER KEEPS A MAN FROM PURSUING HIS DESTINY
sample-003592.wav,I TURNED AND AS I DID SO THE SCREW MUST HAVE FALLEN OUT
sample-003593.wav,NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN
sample-003594.wav,I'M GOING TO THEM
sample-003595.wav,I WANT MY HUSBAND TO WANDER AS FREE AS THE WIND THAT SHAPES THE DUNES
sample-003596.wav,THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sample-003597.wav,YOU CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT MY FATHER
sample-003598.wav,I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BUILDING AND LOAN
sample-003599.wav,HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
sample-003600.wav,BUT THE ENGLISHMAN APPEARED NOT TO ATTACH ANY IMPORTANCE TO IT
sample-003601.wav,I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING
sample-003602.wav,YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
sample-003603.wav,IF HE EVER DECIDED TO LEAVE THEM THEY WOULD SUFFER
sample-003604.wav,GET THE GOVERNOR ON THE PHONE
sample-003605.wav,HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
sample-003606.wav,WHERE DO YOU LIVE SHOUTED THE BOY AS THE HORSEMAN RODE AWAY
sample-003607.wav,THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AT HIS THOUGHTS
sample-003608.wav,SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY TO ME
sample-003609.wav,SHE'S A WONDERFUL PERSON
sample-003610.wav,CAME TO THE BAR HE HAD ENTERED ON HIS FIRST DAY THERE
sample-003611.wav,HOW DO YOU DO
sample-003612.wav,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
sample-003613.wav,THIS DESERT WAS ONCE A SEA HE SAID
sample-003614.wav,I FORGOT YOU WERE HERE
sample-003615.wav,WHAT'S SHE DOING OVER HERE
sample-003616.wav,MAYBE HE'LL GIVE US ONE
sample-003617.wav,THAT SOBERED HIM A LITTLE
sample-003618.wav,WHAT'D YOU WISH WHEN YOU THREW THAT ROCK
sample-003619.wav,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
sample-003620.wav,HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR
sample-003621.wav,THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
sample-003622.wav,WATCH OVER HER TONIGHT
sample-003623.wav,YOUR MOTHER AND I TALKED IT OVER HALF THE NIGHT
sample-003624.wav,THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
sample-003625.wav,HE CARRIED TWO DEAD HAWKS OVER HIS SHOULDER
sample-003626.wav,HUNCHES HIS MOTHER USED TO CALL THEM
sample-003627.wav,WELL USUALLY I LEARN MORE FROM MY SHEEP THAN FROM BOOKS HE ANSWERED
sample-003628.wav,WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE
sample-003629.wav,YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE EIGHT THOUSAND BUCKS ON YOU
sample-003630.wav,MAYBE THIS IS AN OMEN SAID THE ENGLISHMAN HALF ALOUD
sample-003631.wav,WAIT FOR THE END OF THE WAR
sample-003632.wav,WELL THEN WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM
sample-003633.wav,I'M A SUCKER FOR IT
sample-003634.wav,WHY CAN'T YOU BE SERIOUS
sample-003635.wav,AS HE LOOKED AT THE STONES HE FELT RELIEVED FOR SOME REASON
sample-003636.wav,WE'VE BEEN LAUGHING ALL DAY ABOUT THAT
sample-003637.wav,ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
sample-003638.wav,PUT DOWN THAT CHAIR
sample-003639.wav,AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE
sample-003640.wav,THEY WERE BOTH SILENT FOR A TIME OBSERVING THE PLAZA AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE
sample-003641.wav,THIS IS THE FIRST PHASE OF THE JOB HE SAID
sample-003642.wav,HENDERSON WENT INTO THE RAILWAY STATION TO TELEGRAPH THE NEWS TO LONDON
sample-003643.wav,BUT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS EXULTANT
sample-003644.wav,SHE NEEDS TO GET HER TRANSCRIPTS AND PASSPORT FIRST
sample-003645.wav,SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
sample-003646.wav,I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE BY
sample-003647.wav,THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
sample-003648.wav,YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE
sample-003649.wav,SOME DO COME BACK
sample-003650.wav,LOTS OF SHEPHERDS PASSED THROUGH SELLING THEIR WOOL
sample-003651.wav,AND HE KNEW WHAT WAS THE FAIR PRICE FOR EVERY ONE OF HIS ANIMALS
sample-003652.wav,SUDDENLY HE DISAPPEARED AND I COULD HEAR A FAINT SHRIEK BEHIND THE WALLS
sample-003653.wav,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sample-003654.wav,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
sample-003655.wav,MEANWHILE THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT HIS TREASURE
sample-003656.wav,SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
sample-003657.wav,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sample-003658.wav,WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE CAN'T GET AWAY
sample-003659.wav,NOW IT WILL BE WITH HOPE
sample-003660.wav,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sample-003661.wav,AND I WILL TELL YOU HOW TO FIND THE HIDDEN TREASURE
sample-003662.wav,AND THE GIRL POINTED TO THE SOUTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THERE THE STRANGE MAN LIVED
sample-003663.wav,DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN ABANDONED CHURCH
sample-003664.wav,I'LL TELL YOU IN A MINUTE
sample-003665.wav,I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS
sample-003666.wav,THE ELEVATORS ARE STILL RUNNING
sample-003667.wav,THE FACT THAT THE TWO HOURS HAD STRETCHED INTO AN ENTIRE YEAR DIDN'T MATTER
sample-003668.wav,I'VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE
sample-003669.wav,BUT THERE WAS A SIXTH DAY THE SUN WENT ON
sample-003670.wav,AREN'T WE GODLIKE
sample-003671.wav,WHEN HE'S AN OLD MAN HE'S GOING TO SPEND A MONTH IN AFRICA
sample-003672.wav,AT NIGHT THEY SPREAD THEIR SLEEPING GEAR AND KEPT THEIR FIRES HIDDEN
sample-003673.wav,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sample-003674.wav,I HEARD WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER DAY WITH THE ALCHEMIST THE WIND SAID
sample-003675.wav,I HAPPEN TO KNOW CONWAY WAS MARRIED ONLY THREE MONTHS AGO
sample-003676.wav,IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sample-003677.wav,BUT SHE'LL BE THERE
sample-003678.wav,AS THEY MOVED ALONG THE BOY TRIED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART
sample-003679.wav,YOU'LL MARRY FATIMA AND YOU'LL BOTH BE HAPPY FOR A YEAR
sample-003680.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-003681.wav,I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING MORE
sample-003682.wav,THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES
sample-003683.wav,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sample-003684.wav,THE WIND HAS MANY NAMES
sample-003685.wav,I'LL COVER THE METHOD I USE AND DESCRIBE SOME ALTERNATIVES
sample-003686.wav,AND I'M CERTAIN YOU'LL FIND IT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sample-003687.wav,THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUARDS STOOD AT ATTENTION
sample-003688.wav,AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
sample-003689.wav,WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP OUR CLUB
sample-003690.wav,ANOTHER PERSON WAS THERE TO HELP HIM TOWARD HIS DESTINY
sample-003691.wav,THE CHARCOAL BURNED AWAY TO WHITE ASH
sample-003692.wav,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
sample-003693.wav,YOU CAN'T SEE THE PLANET WITH THE NAKED EYE
sample-003694.wav,HE SHOULD HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A SHEPHERD THE BOY SAID
sample-003695.wav,SHE KEEPS SAYING THAT SHE HAS NO REGRETS ABOUT MOVING BACK HOME BUT IM NOT SURE IF ITS ENTIRELY TRUE
sample-003696.wav,DON'T THEY USUALLY KEEP THE GUN ON THE FLOOR
sample-003697.wav,I'M AFRAID SHE'D FEEL ASHAMED TO THINK SHE HADN'T TRUSTED YOU
sample-003698.wav,MANY PEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE SURREY AND MIDDLESEX MUST HAVE SEEN IT
sample-003699.wav,THE OMENS WILL BEGIN INSISTENTLY TO SPEAK OF IT AND YOU'LL TRY TO IGNORE THEM
sample-003700.wav,THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
sample-003701.wav,COME INTO THE OFFICE A MINUTE
sample-003702.wav,IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE
sample-003703.wav,FRANK WAS DYING SO THEY WERE FORCED TO LEAVE HIM
sample-003704.wav,YOU ARE WISE BECAUSE YOU OBSERVE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE THE BOY SAID
sample-003705.wav,THERE'S ONE THAT SAYS 'EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ONCE CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
sample-003706.wav,MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sample-003707.wav,LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
sample-003708.wav,THOUSANDS OF WORKERS COMMUTE FROM THE SURROUNDINGS INTO THE CITY EACH DAY
sample-003709.wav,THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
sample-003710.wav,BUT THEY WERE NOT THERE
sample-003711.wav,SO HE BEGAN TO WANDER THROUGH THE CITY AND FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATES
sample-003712.wav,IS MUCH LESS SENSITIVE TO SPURIOUS AWAKENINGS THAN THE SLEEP MODE
sample-003713.wav,THAT'S THE REASON WHY I CAME IN FOURTH
sample-003714.wav,ONCE YOU GET INTO THE DESERT THERE'S NO GOING BACK SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sample-003715.wav,I PROMISED THAT I WOULD MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
sample-003716.wav,I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUND TWENTY DOLLARS
sample-003717.wav,THEY SAID NOTHING ELSE
sample-003718.wav,HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD
sample-003719.wav,AND WE HAD A BITE
sample-003720.wav,NOT EVEN A STICK OF GUM
sample-003721.wav,HE KNEW HE WAS STRONGER THAN HIS FRIEND
sample-003722.wav,THE CITY WAS STILL SLEEPING
sample-003723.wav,THAT MAKES SENSE THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-003724.wav,THE ARTICLE IN THE CURRENT STATE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUBLICATION
sample-003725.wav,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sample-003726.wav,I LEFT HER HANGING AROUND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS
sample-003727.wav,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sample-003728.wav,HER WALLS WERE COVERED WITH DARK AND SCARY SKETCHES
sample-003729.wav,HERE I AM BETWEEN MY FLOCK AND MY TREASURE THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-003730.wav,BUT MEN BEGAN TO REJECT SIMPLE THINGS AND TO WRITE TRACTS INTERPRETATIONS AND PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES
sample-003731.wav,ONE THAT WILL WRITE
sample-003732.wav,I'M AFRAID IT'LL BE STEVE TINA
sample-003733.wav,DON'T GIVE IN TO YOUR FEARS SAID THE ALCHEMIST IN A STRANGELY GENTLE VOICE
sample-003734.wav,I'VE GOT A DESK I WANT MOVED
sample-003735.wav,IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
sample-003736.wav,I DONT MIND WORKING FROM HOME MOST OF THE TIME BUT I DO MISS HAVING COWORKERS
sample-003737.wav,THAT WAS THE LAW OF HOSPITALITY
sample-003738.wav,THE BOY WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT HIS FRIEND HAD SIMPLY BECOME SEPARATED FROM HIM BY ACCIDENT
sample-003739.wav,DID YOU SEE THE GARDEN THAT IT TOOK THE MASTER GARDENER TEN YEARS TO CREATE
sample-003740.wav,HE DIDN'T SEDUCE HER WITH HIS WORDS BUT WITH SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES THAT'S THE TRICK
sample-003741.wav,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sample-003742.wav,I'M COMING FATIMA HE SAID
sample-003743.wav,I WANT TO GET BACK TO MY SHEEP FASTER
sample-003744.wav,WE ARE PART OF THAT SOUL SO WE RARELY RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS WORKING FOR US
sample-003745.wav,AND THERE YOU WERE IN BED
sample-003746.wav,AIR WAS EITHER ENTERING OR ESCAPING AT THE RIM WITH A THIN SIZZLING SOUND
sample-003747.wav,THE BOY LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OVENS AND OTHER APPARATUS USED IN ALCHEMY BUT SAW NONE
sample-003748.wav,SUPPOSE THERE WAS A SHANE YORK AND HE WALKED INTO THIS OFFICE
sample-003749.wav,HE WRAPPED THE TWIGS IN A PIECE OF CLOTH AND PUT THEM BACK IN HIS BAG
sample-003750.wav,HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sample-003751.wav,I HAVEN'T WON MY WINGS YET
sample-003752.wav,I THINK YOU'RE A GREAT GUY
sample-003753.wav,WHAT'S THIS THE END OF THE EIGHTH
sample-003754.wav,THE BOY WAS EMBARRASSED AND CONFESSED THAT HE HAD OBSERVED NOTHING
sample-003755.wav,AND ABOVE ALL DON'T FORGET TO FOLLOW YOUR DESTINY THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION
sample-003756.wav,HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sample-003757.wav,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TURN THEM INTO REALITY
sample-003758.wav,HE STARTED TO READ THE BOOK HE HAD BOUGHT
sample-003759.wav,WHERE ARE WE GOING
sample-003760.wav,FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
sample-003761.wav,HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS
sample-003762.wav,FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
sample-003763.wav,I DONT MIND WORKING FROM HOME MOST OF THE TIME BUT I DO MISS HAVING COWORKERS
sample-003764.wav,SO YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE THE BOY SAID
sample-003765.wav,ONCE YOU GET FAMILIAR WITH IT YOU WILL WANT TO USE IT FOR EVERYTHING
sample-003766.wav,THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
sample-003767.wav,TO NOURISH THE FALCON
sample-003768.wav,I LOCKED EYES WITH A FISH IN THE TANK
sample-003769.wav,I WANT TO SEE HIM DO IT SAID THE CHIEF
sample-003770.wav,BUT BAKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERDS
sample-003771.wav,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sample-003772.wav,YOU HAVE DEVELOPED A SERIOUS CASE OF PNEUMONIA
sample-003773.wav,BUT THE TRADITION ALSO SAYS THAT WE SHOULD BELIEVE THE MESSAGES OF THE DESERT
sample-003774.wav,IN ALCHEMY IT'S CALLED THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
sample-003775.wav,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sample-003776.wav,HE WATCHED THE HAWKS AS THEY DRIFTED ON THE WIND
sample-003777.wav,GOLD WOULD LOSE ITS VALUE
sample-003778.wav,WE'LL LEAVE TOMORROW BEFORE SUNRISE WAS THE ALCHEMIST'S ONLY RESPONSE
sample-003779.wav,HE HAD NOT A CENT IN HIS POCKET BUT HE HAD FAITH
sample-003780.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN HAD SEVERAL SUITCASES FILLED WITH BOOKS
sample-003781.wav,BUT HORSES TIRE BIT BY BIT
sample-003782.wav,THEY BEGAN TO RIDE OUT OVER THE SANDS WITH THE MOON LIGHTING THEIR WAY
sample-003783.wav,JUST ONE MORE TRY
sample-003784.wav,HE WON'T LEAVE THE CIRCLE
sample-003785.wav,LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
sample-003786.wav,LOTS OF SHEPHERDS PASSED THROUGH SELLING THEIR WOOL
sample-003787.wav,OUR MERCHANTS BOUGHT THAT MAN AND BROUGHT HIM TO EGYPT
sample-003788.wav,IT SPOKE OF JOURNEYS DISCOVERIES BOOKS AND CHANGE
sample-003789.wav,I ALMOST DROPPED HIM
sample-003790.wav,THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
sample-003791.wav,SO HIS HEART WAS QUIET FOR AN ENTIRE AFTERNOON
sample-003792.wav,THE RIVER BABBLED INANELY TO ITSELF
sample-003793.wav,THE AIRPLANE ROSE GRACEFULLY INTO THE SKY
sample-003794.wav,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sample-003795.wav,THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
sample-003796.wav,BUT WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME WHO GOES OUT
sample-003797.wav,THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THE BOY DUG AT THE PLACE HE HAD CHOSEN BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-003798.wav,SHE HAS CHIPPED A FINGERNAIL
sample-003799.wav,GET A LOAD OF THIS
sample-003800.wav,WITHOUT SUCH LOVE ONE'S DREAMS WOULD HAVE NO MEANING
sample-003801.wav,DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
sample-003802.wav,WOULDN'T DO ANY GOOD
sample-003803.wav,I THOUGHT SURE YOU'D REMEMBER ME
sample-003804.wav,HE DECANTED THE WINE AND BEGAN TO RECOUNT THE DISTURBING STORY HE HAD BEEN TOLD
sample-003805.wav,YOU MAY KISS MY HAND
sample-003806.wav,AS THE SUN ROSE THE MEN BEGAN TO BEAT THE BOY
sample-003807.wav,THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
sample-003808.wav,I HAD TO TEST YOUR COURAGE THE STRANGER SAID
sample-003809.wav,WHERE'D YOU GET IT
sample-003810.wav,THE WORLD SPEAKS MANY LANGUAGES THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-003811.wav,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sample-003812.wav,YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
sample-003813.wav,I'LL HANG IT UP
sample-003814.wav,EVERYONE HAS HIS OR HER OWN WAY OF LEARNING THINGS HE SAID TO HIMSELF
sample-003815.wav,THE ALCHEMISTS SPENT YEARS IN THEIR LABORATORIES OBSERVING THE FIRE THAT PURIFIED THE METALS
sample-003816.wav,HANG ON FOR A SECOND
sample-003817.wav,TWO WOMEN WERE STILL MISSING WHEN THE FIREFIGHTERS ARRIVED
sample-003818.wav,DO YOU KNOW WHAT
sample-003819.wav,HEY WHAT DO YOU SAY
sample-003820.wav,THAT NIGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER JETTING OUT OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET
sample-003821.wav,THAT'S WHEN HE'LL BE SAFE AND NOT A MINUTE BEFORE
sample-003822.wav,TWO DAYS LATER THE MERCHANT SPOKE TO THE BOY ABOUT THE DISPLAY
sample-003823.wav,I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-003824.wav,WHERE'S THAT AIRLINES BAG
sample-003825.wav,THE PINK LOVE HEART KEYRING GLOWED
sample-003826.wav,TEN YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY AND HERE I AM IN A CORRAL
sample-003827.wav,MANY PEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE SURREY AND MIDDLESEX MUST HAVE SEEN IT
sample-003828.wav,SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET HURT
sample-003829.wav,THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
sample-003830.wav,THE BOY WAS BECOMING NERVOUS
sample-003831.wav,AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sample-003832.wav,SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
sample-003833.wav,AND IF IT IS
sample-003834.wav,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sample-003835.wav,I WANTED THEM TO BE A PART OF YOUR INHERITANCE
sample-003836.wav,THE CHAIR HAD LEATHER UPHOLSTERY
sample-003837.wav,ANY STATEMENT ON THE RED UPRISING TOMORROW
sample-003838.wav,BUT THE BOY WAS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THEM
sample-003839.wav,I'D LIKE TO BUILD A DISPLAY CASE FOR THE CRYSTAL THE BOY SAID TO THE MERCHANT
sample-003840.wav,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
sample-003841.wav,ABOUT AN HOUR AGO
sample-003842.wav,I GOT IT BACK
sample-003843.wav,I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
sample-003844.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
sample-003845.wav,BUT THAT'S THE JAIL
sample-003846.wav,ANOTHER DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLER TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
sample-003847.wav,HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR
sample-003848.wav,IT'S NOT WHAT ENTERS MEN'S MOUTHS THAT'S EVIL SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-003849.wav,THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH A HORSE
sample-003850.wav,THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE ELDERS
sample-003851.wav,I THOUGHT THE UNSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sample-003852.wav,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
sample-003853.wav,I FORGOT MY HAT
sample-003854.wav,WHAT'S MY NAME DOING ON IT
sample-003855.wav,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
sample-003856.wav,I FEEL SICK WHAT SHOULD I DO
sample-003857.wav,IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
sample-003858.wav,HE SAW THE BOY APPEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DUNES
sample-003859.wav,I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO
sample-003860.wav,BUT SHE IS GONE
sample-003861.wav,AND THEY ATTACKED AN EMPTY TENT
sample-003862.wav,HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
sample-003863.wav,YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE COMMOTION IN THAT LOCKER ROOM
sample-003864.wav,I'VE GOT A FLASH FOR YOU
sample-003865.wav,DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HERD AT AN ABANDONED CHURCH
sample-003866.wav,COACH HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU
sample-003867.wav,THAT'S THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE AND THE ELIXIR OF LIFE
sample-003868.wav,WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING
sample-003869.wav,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sample-003870.wav,THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
sample-003871.wav,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
sample-003872.wav,GIVE ME PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO DECONTAMINATE THE TROOPER
sample-003873.wav,THE BOY LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OVENS AND OTHER APPARATUS USED IN ALCHEMY BUT SAW NONE
sample-003874.wav,YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND
sample-003875.wav,THE OLD MAN WORE A BREASTPLATE OF HEAVY GOLD COVERED WITH PRECIOUS STONES
sample-003876.wav,IT MAY BE THE GASES OF THE FIRING THAT CAUSED THE MARTIANS INCONVENIENCE
sample-003877.wav,THEN SHE GOT OUT THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT
sample-003878.wav,AND NOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY FATHER IS
sample-003879.wav,THAT'S ALL I ASK
sample-003880.wav,DO YOU KNOW HIM
sample-003881.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-003882.wav,AND I WILL BE THE POLICEMAN
sample-003883.wav,DON'T YOU PUSH ME AROUND LIKE THAT
sample-003884.wav,THE BOY WENT TO LOOK FOR THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-003885.wav,THE SHEEP WILL GET USED TO MY NOT BEING THERE TOO THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-003886.wav,IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sample-003887.wav,I WAS EXPECTING YOU
sample-003888.wav,THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES
sample-003889.wav,THE DESCENT WAS DISTURBINGLY STEEP
sample-003890.wav,WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU TWO GUYS
sample-003891.wav,WHAT WOULD YOU SAY ABOUT THAT
sample-003892.wav,THAT WAS A LITTLE GIRL NAMED MARY HATCH
sample-003893.wav,SHE SAT ON THE FLOOR DRINKING HER COFFEE
sample-003894.wav,AND THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WELL
sample-003895.wav,SHE KNOWS THAT MEN HAVE TO GO AWAY IN ORDER TO RETURN
sample-003896.wav,OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
sample-003897.wav,WE'VE STILL GOT TWO BUCKS LEFT
sample-003898.wav,THANK YOU VERY MUCH
sample-003899.wav,YOU'LL ASK ME TO WHAT
sample-003900.wav,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-003901.wav,APPARENTLY IT'S THE DUMPLINGS THAT MAKE THIS STEW TASTE SO GOOD
sample-003902.wav,BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GO INTO BATTLE
sample-003903.wav,SHE'S ACCUSED OF STEALING A WATCH
sample-003904.wav,THE BOY LOOKED OUT AT THE HORIZON
sample-003905.wav,WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP OUR CLUB
sample-003906.wav,FROM THEN ON HE WOULD MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS
sample-003907.wav,HE MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID ENCOUNTERS WITH THIEVES
sample-003908.wav,HIS HANDS WERE ABRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HEART
sample-003909.wav,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sample-003910.wav,AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sample-003911.wav,THEY JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW
sample-003912.wav,FOOT PEDALS ARE ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO VOICE COMMANDS
sample-003913.wav,THE BOY'S HEART BEGAN TO SPEAK OF FEAR
sample-003914.wav,BUT THE KING OF SALEM HOPED DESPERATELY THAT THE BOY WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL
sample-003915.wav,ANOTHER TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-003916.wav,AN HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
sample-003917.wav,WHEN THE BLINDING DUST HAD SETTLED A BIT THE BOY TREMBLED AT WHAT HE SAW
sample-003918.wav,THE SECRET IS HERE IN THE PRESENT
sample-003919.wav,SHE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A CHEAP COPY BUT SHE DIDNT WANT TO KNOW
sample-003920.wav,I'M LOOKING FOR A TREASURE SAID THE BOY AND HE IMMEDIATELY REGRETTED HAVING SAID IT
sample-003921.wav,I'D KNOW THAT VOICE ANYWHERE
sample-003922.wav,THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
sample-003923.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sample-003924.wav,BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
sample-003925.wav,OTHER SERVANTS MAINTAINED THE FIRES IN THE HOOKAHS
sample-003926.wav,WHAT IS MY FUNCTION
sample-003927.wav,IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
sample-003928.wav,NEXT YOU'LL WANT TO ENUMERATE TABS SO YOU CAN QUICKLY JUMP BETWEEN THEM
sample-003929.wav,AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
sample-003930.wav,IT'S A PRIVATE CLUB FOR ONLY THE MOST RESPECTABLE PEOPLE
sample-003931.wav,HE WAS GOING TO MISS THE PLACE AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS HE HAD LEARNED
sample-003932.wav,DISREGARD MY LAST STATEMENT
sample-003933.wav,HE RESTARTED HIS EFFORTS FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME
sample-003934.wav,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
sample-003935.wav,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-003936.wav,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
sample-003937.wav,BUT THE MARKETPLACE WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS FAR FROM HOME SO HE WEPT
sample-003938.wav,THE SHOWER'S IN THERE
sample-003939.wav,AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
sample-003940.wav,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sample-003941.wav,I WONDER WHAT'S EATING THAT OLD MONEY GRUBBING BUZZARD ANYWAY
sample-003942.wav,I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OFF HER PHONE
sample-003943.wav,I'M DYING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE
sample-003944.wav,GET A LOAD OF THIS
sample-003945.wav,ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY USES PAIRS OF KEYS
sample-003946.wav,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
sample-003947.wav,I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
sample-003948.wav,YOU'D THINK I WAS ON THE WITNESS STAND
sample-003949.wav,WITH A BAG OF MARSHMALLOWS
sample-003950.wav,AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
sample-003951.wav,IF SOMEONE ISN'T WHAT OTHERS WANT THEM TO BE THE OTHERS BECOME ANGRY
sample-003952.wav,THE TELLER DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH CHANGE
sample-003953.wav,SOMETHING BRIGHT REFLECTED FROM HIS CHEST WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT THE BOY WAS MOMENTARILY BLINDED
sample-003954.wav,I'LL BE BACK THE BOY SAID
sample-003955.wav,IT'S NOT I THE WIND SPOKE ABOUT
sample-003956.wav,THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT FLAGS UP THERE NOW
sample-003957.wav,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-003958.wav,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
sample-003959.wav,BUT THEN I REALIZED SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
sample-003960.wav,EXACTLY ANSWERED THE ALCHEMIST
sample-003961.wav,OR A MAN INTO THE WIND
sample-003962.wav,THE BOY REMINDED THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HIDDEN TREASURE
sample-003963.wav,NO SENSE IN GOING UP THERE
sample-003964.wav,IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE THE LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
sample-003965.wav,ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
sample-003966.wav,OTHER SERVANTS MAINTAINED THE FIRES IN THE HOOKAHS
sample-003967.wav,AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY
sample-003968.wav,HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURN TO HIS MEDITATION
sample-003969.wav,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sample-003970.wav,CREATIVITY IS NOT SOMETHING EXCLUSIVE TO HUMANS
sample-003971.wav,I'LL RETURN JUST AS YOUR FATHER CAME BACK TO YOUR MOTHER HE SAID
sample-003972.wav,THEN SHE TOOK BOTH OF HIS HANDS IN HERS AND BEGAN QUIETLY TO PRAY
sample-003973.wav,THESE TROUSERS DON'T FIT VERY WELL
sample-003974.wav,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
sample-003975.wav,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
sample-003976.wav,AFTER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND ACHIEVE GREAT HEIGHTS
sample-003977.wav,STRONG PASSWORDS DON'T HAVE TO BE HARD TO REMEMBER
sample-003978.wav,ALWAYS ASK AN OBJECTIVE QUESTION
sample-003979.wav,HE WASN'T ASKING FOR HELP
sample-003980.wav,THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
sample-003981.wav,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sample-003982.wav,THE BOY SMILED AND CONTINUED DIGGING
sample-003983.wav,YOU CAN GET AROUND VERY EASILY BY TRAIN  WHICH IS A VERY RELAXING AND AFFORDABLE WAY TO TRAVEL
sample-003984.wav,WHAT KIND OF A PROOF IS THAT
sample-003985.wav,YOU MEAN YOU DON'T APPROVE OF MY HAVING A BABY
sample-003986.wav,IT COMMENCED TO BLOW HARDER RAISING THE DESERT SANDS
sample-003987.wav,THAT GUY OVER THERE LIKES TO DRINK A LOT TALK A LOT BUT DO NOTHING
sample-003988.wav,LET'S STOP THIS ANOTHER COMMANDER SAID
sample-003989.wav,THE ANIMALS WERE EXHAUSTED AND THE MEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES LESS AND LESS
sample-003990.wav,YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT BUTTER
sample-003991.wav,IT SEEMS OLD AND WISE
sample-003992.wav,THE LEAD HAD DRIED INTO THE SHAPE OF THE PAN BUT IT WAS NO LONGER LEAD
sample-003993.wav,HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS
sample-003994.wav,HE SAT LOOKING AT THE SKY FOR A LONG TIME
sample-003995.wav,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
sample-003996.wav,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
sample-003997.wav,BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
sample-003998.wav,NOW THAT'S TOO MUCH
sample-003999.wav,OGILVY WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
sample-004000.wav,GIVE HER THE WORKS
sample-004001.wav,GO THROUGH WITH WHAT
sample-004002.wav,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-004003.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sample-004004.wav,HE DECIDED TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE
sample-004005.wav,THEY FORMED HEAPS THAT ARE VISIBLE A MILE AND A HALF AWAY
sample-004006.wav,I WOULD HAVE WON THE JUNIOR OLYMPICS IF NOT FOR THOSE MEDALING KIDS
sample-004007.wav,HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURN TO HIS MEDITATION
sample-004008.wav,GO INTO YOUR DANCE
sample-004009.wav,ALTHOUGH SEARCHING IN BINARY SEARCH TREES IS EFFICIENT YOU WON'T FIND ANY FRUITS IN THERE
sample-004010.wav,THERE WERE RAISED VOICESAND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON 
sample-004011.wav,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
sample-004012.wav,HOW DID YOU LEARN TO READ THE GIRL ASKED AT ONE POINT
sample-004013.wav,TO NOURISH THE FALCON
sample-004014.wav,THEY WERE KNOWN AS SEERS AND THEY WERE HELD IN FEAR BY WOMEN AND THE ELDERLY
sample-004015.wav,TRYING TO IMPROVE THE WORLD BY JUMPING UP AND DOWN
sample-004016.wav,MR LEE CAN'T BE BOTHERED NOW
sample-004017.wav,IT MUST HAVE FALLEN WHILE I WAS SITTING OVER THERE
sample-004018.wav,JUST LIKE AN ORGAN
sample-004019.wav,RAISINS ARE DELICIOUS
sample-004020.wav,TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM
sample-004021.wav,SO THEN TRY HE SAID TO THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-004022.wav,THE ANGEL TOUCHED THE MAN'S SHOULDER AND THEY WERE BOTH PROJECTED FAR INTO THE FUTURE
sample-004023.wav,YOU WANT THE MOON
sample-004024.wav,LOTS OF PLACES SELL TEA AROUND HERE THE MERCHANT SAID
sample-004025.wav,I'M BEGINNING TO LIKE THIS
sample-004026.wav,BUT MOST IMPORTANT HE WAS ABLE EVERY DAY TO LIVE OUT HIS DREAM
sample-004027.wav,DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
sample-004028.wav,THE ONE IN THERE
sample-004029.wav,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sample-004030.wav,THE MERCHANT LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE BOY
sample-004031.wav,WHERE DID HE KEEP HIS MONEY
sample-004032.wav,I LEARNED THE ALCHEMIST'S SECRETS IN MY TRAVELS
sample-004033.wav,AS HE LOOKED AT THE STONES HE FELT RELIEVED FOR SOME REASON
sample-004034.wav,WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE CONFOUNDED THING DO YOU
sample-004035.wav,THE BOY WAS STARTLED
sample-004036.wav,THREE CHEERS FOR ADEN CHRISTOPHER
sample-004037.wav,AND THE SOLID PART WAS CALLED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
sample-004038.wav,ITS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE SHE LAST READ CHEKHOV AND BECAUSE OF THAT SHE NO LONGER FEELS LIKE THE HEROINE OF HER OWN STORY
sample-004039.wav,ARE YOU ENJOYING LONDON
sample-004040.wav,THEY PLACED THE SYMBOLS OF THE PILGRIMAGE ON THE DOORS OF THEIR HOUSES
sample-004041.wav,HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD
sample-004042.wav,ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
sample-004043.wav,I'M GOING INTO THE DESERT THE MAN ANSWERED TURNING BACK TO HIS READING
sample-004044.wav,AS THE SUN ROSE THE MEN BEGAN TO BEAT THE BOY
sample-004045.wav,I HAVE TO FIND A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
sample-004046.wav,THE PICNIC WAS RUINED BY A MARCHING BAND
sample-004047.wav,HOW COME YOU SPEAK SPANISH HE ASKED
sample-004048.wav,DID YOU EVER WALK INTO THIS OFFICE
sample-004049.wav,I'M SURE SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT
sample-004050.wav,WHEN THE SIMUM CEASED TO BLOW EVERYONE LOOKED TO THE PLACE WHERE THE BOY HAD BEEN
sample-004051.wav,EVERYTHING LOOKED DIFFUSE AFTER SHE TOOK THE NARCOTIC
sample-004052.wav,AND EVENTUALLY MAN WILL NOURISH YOUR SANDS WHERE THE GAME WILL ONCE AGAIN FLOURISH
sample-004053.wav,IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
sample-004054.wav,THE CURSOR BLINKED EXPECTANTLY
sample-004055.wav,THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SUFFUSED WITH THE SWEET SCENT OF SMOKE
sample-004056.wav,THE GIRL DROPPED THE CONTAINER AND THE WATER SPILLED
sample-004057.wav,FRESH COFFEE IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE FREEZE DRIED STUFF
sample-004058.wav,I CAN ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-004059.wav,THE BOY WAS ALSO SADDENED HIS FRIEND WAS IN PURSUIT OF HIS DESTINY
sample-004060.wav,I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO LAST FOR A LONG TIME HE SAID TO THE MONK
sample-004061.wav,THEY DRANK THEIR MILK AND FELL ASLEEP
sample-004062.wav,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-004063.wav,THEY BECOME THE SOUL O F THE WORLD
sample-004064.wav,WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
sample-004065.wav,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
sample-004066.wav,THAT'S THE MAN WHO KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS OF THE WORLD SHE SAID
sample-004067.wav,THEY REACHED THE CENTER OF A LARGE PLAZA WHERE THE MARKET WAS HELD
sample-004068.wav,HE WAS THINKING ABOUT OMENS AND SOMEONE HAD APPEARED
sample-004069.wav,NO SENSE MESSING UP THE STREETS
sample-004070.wav,I CAN SEE THAT
sample-004071.wav,BUT THEY COULD NEVER HAVE TAUGHT HIM ARABIC
sample-004072.wav,HE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON MORE PRACTICAL MATTERS
sample-004073.wav,THAT'S WHAT I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY
sample-004074.wav,JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
sample-004075.wav,THE CITY SEALER'S OFFICE
