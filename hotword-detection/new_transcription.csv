sample-000129.mp3,HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS
sample-000130.mp3,USING SCRIPBLOCKERS IS GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA BUT IT REQUIRES THE USER TO LEARN A BIT
sample-000131.mp3,SO WHEN I LOOK OUT OVER YOUR SANSE I AM ALSO LOOKING AT HER
sample-000132.mp3,HE'S HOME COOKING DINNER
sample-000133.mp3,LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE STANDARD DEVIATION
sample-000134.mp3,NOW THAT'S TOO MUCH

sample-000163.mp3,I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER AFTER THE BOAT SAILS
sample-000164.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN DIDN'T ANSWER HIM DIRECTLY
sample-000165.mp3,HE FELT WEIGHTED DOWN BY THE SENTURIES OF TIME SINCE THE PYRAMIDS HAD BEEN BUILT
sample-000166.mp3,FATIMA THE GIRITA AVERNING HER EYES
sample-000167.mp3,THE BOY WAS RELIEVED

sample-000183.mp3,LEARN TO RECOGNIZE OMENS AND FOLLOW THEM THE OLD KING HAD SAID
sample-000184.mp3,BURLING CAN BE SO LOVELY THIS TIME OF YEAR
sample-000185.mp3,LAURA TOOK OUT A CIGARETTE AND PLACED IT IN HER MAP
sample-000186.mp3,THEY WERE FASCINATING STORIES EACH OF THEM LIVED OUT ITS DESTINY TO THE END
sample-000187.mp3,THE VISION VANISHED IMMEDIATELY BUT IT HAD SHAKEN HIM
sample-000188.mp3,ONE CAN IMAGINE THESE TWO COVERED WITH SAND RUNNING UP THE LITTLE STREET IN THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT
sample-000189.mp3,CROOKS DON'T PAY TEXAS
sample-000190.mp3,THE OMENS HAD TOLD HIM SO
sample-000191.mp3,BUT THE BOY KNEW THAT HE WAS REFERRING TO FATIMA
sample-000192.mp3,THE ARAB ACCEPTED THEM WITHOUT A WORD
sample-000193.mp3,BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sample-000194.mp3,WELCOME TODAVE'S GUITAR SESSION

sample-000199.mp3,BOUGHT A LOVELY JOP
sample-000200.mp3,AT THAT TIME IT WAS QUITE CLEAR IN MY OWN MIND THAT THE THING HAD COME FROM THE PLANET MARS
sample-000201.mp3,THAT'S NOT SO BAD
sample-000202.mp3,HOW STRANGE AFRICA IS THOUGHT THE BOY
sample-000203.mp3,HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
sample-000204.mp3,FOR EVERY TEN THEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
sample-000205.mp3,AND EVENTUALLY MAN WOOL NOURISH YOUR SANDS WHERE THE GAME WOOL WONT AGAIN FLOURISH
sample-000206.mp3,THE ALCHEMISTS SPENT YEARS IN THEIR LABORATORIES OBSERVING THE FIRE THAT PURIFIED THE METALS
sample-000207.mp3,WE'RE JUST SLOWLY PLODDING THROUGH SOME USER INTERVIEWS AT THE MOMENT

sample-000221.mp3,THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
sample-000222.mp3,AS HE DID SO HE TALKED WITH THE MONK ABOUT THE TRIBAL WARS
sample-000223.mp3,AS HE LOOKED AT THE STONES HE FELT RELIEVED FOR SOME REASON
sample-000224.mp3,IT WAS VERY HALF A HOD OF FOCUTS

sample-000247.mp3,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES

sample-001053.mp3,THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
sample-001054.mp3,THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
sample-001055.mp3,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY INTO THE DARK

sample-001079.mp3,ON THE FIRST DAY HE RETURNED WITH A RABBIT AND ON THE SECOND WITH TWO BIRDS
sample-001080.mp3,THE GUY THOUGHT HE WAS A LUNATIC AT LARGE AND MADE AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO STOP HIM
sample-001081.mp3,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sample-001082.mp3,I'M AN ALCHEMIST SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M AN ALCHEMIST HE SAID AS HE PREPARED THE MEAL

sample-001089.mp3,WHERE DO YOU LIVE SHOUTED THE BOY AS THE HORSEMAN RODE AWAY
sample-001090.mp3,AND HE ASKED THE BOY IF HE TOO WERE IN SEARCH OF THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001091.mp3,HE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ITS DODGES AND TRICKS AND TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS
sample-001092.mp3,YOU LIVED YOUR LIFE IN A LOVING WAY AND DIT WITH DEGINITY
sample-001093.mp3,BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGNOSTICATIONS SAID THE STRANGER
sample-001094.mp3,AN LD WAS INDICATING THE PROXIMITY DETECTOR WAS WORKING PROPERLY

sample-001097.mp3,THERE WAS A TIME WHEN FOR MA A CAMEL'S WHINNYING WATH NOTHING MORE THAN WHINNYING
sample-001098.mp3,YOU HAVE BEEN STOPPING ME
sample-001099.mp3,I'M GOING TO THEM
sample-001100.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST WAS A BIT DAUNTING BUT AS THE BOY DRAGKED THE BINE ITA LAGE
sample-001101.mp3,THE STRANGER WAS SPEAKING OF THINGS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT
sample-001102.mp3,HIRES TWO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND MAKE ONE OF THEM TRAIN THE OTHER ONE
sample-001103.mp3,WHAT'S THE WORLD'S GRATEST LIE THE BOY ASKED COMPLETELY SURPRISED
sample-001104.mp3,THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PRINTING PLACE IN THOSE DAYS</s>THE BOY ARGUE

sample-001109.mp3,YOU'RE THE WOKE OF THE WOOLD
sample-001110.mp3,YOU SHOULD HAVE VALUATED IN A PERCEPTUAL EXPERIMENT
sample-001111.mp3,THEY'D NEVER LET YOU GO
sample-001112.mp3,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
sample-001113.mp3,THEY RETURNED TO THE GATES OF THE MONASTERY
sample-001114.mp3,BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
sample-001115.mp3,THANK YOU VERY MUCH

sample-001124.mp3,THEY WERE KNOWN AS SEERS AND THEY WERE HELD IN FEAR BY WOMAN AND THE EL DELY
sample-001125.mp3,MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE
sample-001126.mp3,LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SANDS
sample-001127.mp3,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sample-001128.mp3,FROM THEN ON HE WOULD MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS
sample-001129.mp3,I HOLD THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH FOR EVERY PERSON I TAKE WITH ME
sample-001130.mp3,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sample-001131.mp3,YOU KNEW THE WHOLE STORY
sample-001132.mp3,HE WAS ABOUT THE SAME AGE AND HATE AS THE BOY
sample-001133.mp3,MOLLABAT THESE INVISIBLE COSMIC CONNECTIONS THAT TRANSCEND TAME AND
sample-001134.mp3,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE

sample-001136.mp3,THAT IS AN ANTELOPE MY SON
sample-001137.mp3,I SHALL MAKE US SOME ICE CUBES
sample-001138.mp3,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sample-001139.mp3,IT HELPED ME TO TRUST IN PEOPLE THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED
sample-001140.mp3,I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID

sample-001145.mp3,DID YOU WANT TO SEE HER ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT
sample-001146.mp3,SAYS FARAGE TO GO THE LIMUT
sample-001147.mp3,HE HAD FOUND WHAT HIS TREASURE WAS AND WAS FRIGHTENED AT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
sample-001148.mp3,WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE
sample-001149.mp3,I'M YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL
sample-001150.mp3,BUT HORSES TIRED BIT BY BIT
sample-001151.mp3,THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sample-001152.mp3,THE SUSPENSION BRIDGE WAS SWINGING IN THE GALE
sample-001153.mp3,THERE HAS BEEN A ROBBERY AT THE BURGLER SHOP IN DOWNTOWN
sample-001154.mp3,SHE KEEPS SAYING THAT SHE HAS NO REGRETS ABOUT MOVING BACK HOME BUT I'M NOT SURE IF ITS ENTIRELY TRUE
sample-001155.mp3,HE'S AFTER THE MONEY
sample-001156.mp3,DON'T ASK ME WHY I DON'T KNOW WHY
sample-001157.mp3,WHEN HE WAS A CHILD THAT MAN WANTED TO TRAVEL TO
sample-001158.mp3,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sample-001159.mp3,THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS ROTADING ON ITS BODY
sample-001160.mp3,LOTS OF SHEPHERDS PASSED THROUGH SELLING THEIR WOOL
sample-001161.mp3,SPEAK TO THE HANDS THAT WROTE ALL SAID THE SUN
sample-001162.mp3,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
sample-001163.mp3,I WAS SITTING WITH MY BEST FRIEND WHEN HE ASKED ME HEY HANNAR CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR

sample-001166.mp3,WELL MON'S GONE KED SITTING AGAIN FOR THE WEEK AND IF YOU WANT TO COME OVER
sample-001167.mp3,THAT NIGHT THERE WAS NOT THE JETTING OF GAS FROM THE DISTANT PLANET

sample-001169.mp3,THE OLD MAN RETURNED THE BOOK TO THE BOY
sample-001170.mp3,THE MAN WIT WITH HAPPINESS
sample-001171.mp3,I AD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE THE BOY SAID
sample-001172.mp3,HE WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE MERCHANT TO AWAKEN AND OPEN THE SHOP
sample-001173.mp3,THEY DON'T SEE THAT THE FIELDS ARE NEW AND THE SEASONS CHANGE
sample-001174.mp3,AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
sample-001175.mp3,YOU'VE GOT LEAPSIC ALL OVER YOUR MOUTH

sample-001180.mp3,SOME OF THOSE WHO SAW ITS FLIGHTS SAY DID TRAVEL WITH A HAZING SOUND
sample-001181.mp3,EVEN FROM A DISTANCE THEIR EYES CONVEYED THE STRENGTH OF THEIR TOULS
sample-001182.mp3,I NEED YOU TO PPEA SPONTANEOUS HE HAS CATTED ME OUT YOUR DING DIN

sample-001185.mp3,VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THROUGHOUT THE TENT
sample-001186.mp3,THE TIME MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX O'CLOCK
sample-001187.mp3,IF HE MAKES A BUYING MISTAKE IT DOESN'T AFFECT HIM MUCH
sample-001188.mp3,USED TO HUNT RABBITS THERE MYSELF
sample-001189.mp3,THE GENIES WERE THE SPIRIT OF GOOD IN EVIL
sample-001190.mp3,NO THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-001191.mp3,HE PUT HIS HEAD CLOGHED IN PLACE AND SECURED IT WITH A RING MADE OF CAMEL SKIN
sample-001192.mp3,IT DREW A DROPLET OF BLOOD
sample-001193.mp3,YOU CAN'T DO THAT
sample-001194.mp3,THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING
sample-001195.mp3,WOU CAN'T LET THE CHRONICLE GET THE LAUGH FROM US
sample-001196.mp3,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GASH FLOAT
sample-001197.mp3,WHEN HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE DUNE HIS HEART LEAPT
sample-001198.mp3,HIS WAY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MINE AS HIS
sample-001199.mp3,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sample-001200.mp3,THE LITTLE GIRL WANTED TO HAVE A BALLOON BUT WAS TOO SHY TO ASK
sample-001201.mp3,ARE YOU ALL RIGHT
sample-001202.mp3,HE SHOULD HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A SHEPHERD THE BOY SAID

sample-001205.mp3,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sample-001206.mp3,OXYGEN IS IMPORTANT FOR US BUT SOME BACKTERIOR DON'T NEED IT AT ALL
sample-001207.mp3,BEING MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD ISN'T NONSENSE
sample-001208.mp3,I'M JUST YOUR LITTLE RENT COLLECTOR
sample-001209.mp3,HE QUICKLY PULLED HIS HANDS AWAY
sample-001210.mp3,WE COULD GET TO THE PYRAMIDS BY TOMORROW SAID THE OTHER TAKING THE MONEY
sample-001211.mp3,THE NEXT DAY THE BOY RETURNED TO THE WIRL HOPING TO SEE THE GIRL
sample-001212.mp3,THE BOY APPROACED HER TO ASK ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001213.mp3,SO USUALLY A KEYPRESS INSTEAD OF A CLICK IS USED
sample-001214.mp3,IT'S IN ALL THE AFTERNOON PAPERS
sample-001215.mp3,IF YOU CAN CONCENTRATE ALWAYS ON THE PRESENT YOU'LL BE A HAPPY MAN
sample-001216.mp3,IT'S CALLED THA PRINCIPLE FAVORABILITY
sample-001217.mp3,YOU GOT THE MAYOR AND PULLMAN BACKED AGAINST A WALL
sample-001218.mp3,BUT AS HE SAW THEM LYING THERE ON THE GROUND ANOTHER PHRASE CAME TO HIS MIND
sample-001219.mp3,WHAT A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY

sample-001363.mp3,WILL YOU GET CLOSE TO HIM
sample-001364.mp3,THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
sample-001365.mp3,SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVOLVED
sample-001366.mp3,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sample-001367.mp3,THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN THE SAND
sample-001368.mp3,DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND A GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERYDAY CONVERSATION
sample-001369.mp3,THE ANIMALS WERE EXHAUSTED AND THE MEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES LESS TAN ONCE
sample-001370.mp3,WALK IN THE GRASS AND MY BARE FEET
sample-001371.mp3,THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GYPSY TOO
sample-001372.mp3,IF WE SERVE TEA IN CRYSTAL THE SHOP IS GOING TO EXPAND
sample-001373.mp3,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sample-001374.mp3,BECAUSE LIFE WANTS YOU TO ACHIEVE YOUR DESTINY
sample-001375.mp3,

sample-001383.mp3,THE ELECTRICIAN LOOK PUZZLED
sample-001384.mp3,I BET YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THOSE
sample-001385.mp3,SO THE WIND BLEW WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH AND THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH SAND
sample-001386.mp3,THEN CAME THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FALLING STY
sample-001387.mp3,WHERE IS THE TREASURE HE ASKED
sample-001388.mp3,IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
sample-001389.mp3,WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT
sample-001390.mp3,THEY'RE NOT MY SHEEP ANYMORE HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITHOUT NOUSTALIA
sample-001391.mp3,THEY WENT ON SMOKING THE PIPE FOR A WHILE AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SET
sample-001392.mp3,HE HAD COME TO THE TOWN ONLY TO FIND A WOMAN WHO COULD INTERPRET HIS DREAM
sample-001393.mp3,WHEN HE WAS IN HOSPITAL THE NURSE TOOK AN EXRA PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS ARM
sample-001394.mp3,HE WANDERED FAREWELL KEEPING THE DEAD PALEMS OF THE ISAS WITHIN SIGHT
sample-001395.mp3,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-001396.mp3,HITTING THE DULY AND ESCAPE KEYS DID NOTHING
sample-001397.mp3,AND EVENTUALLY MAN WILL NOURISH YOUR SANDS WHERE THE GAME WILL ONCE AGAIN FLOURISH
sample-001398.mp3,HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET HIM EXAMINED
sample-001399.mp3,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
sample-001400.mp3,ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN BAYBURY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
sample-001401.mp3,THEY WERE MEN OF THE DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF THE SORCERERS
sample-001402.mp3,DID YOU FINISH THE INTERVIEW
sample-001403.mp3,THEY HAVE THEIR EYES LUWED ON HIS FACE
sample-001404.mp3,SOMETHING TERRIBLETHIS HAPPENED TO ME
sample-001405.mp3,I HAD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-001406.mp3,HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
sample-001407.mp3,BUT HE DECIDED FIRST TO BUY HIS BAKERING AND PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE
sample-001408.mp3,ONLY WE CALL THEM AGENTS
sample-001409.mp3,WHY THE SHOTS STOP AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
sample-001410.mp3,HOW THEY MANAGE TO IMPROVISE HAT SUCH SHORT NOTICE SHE'LL NEVER KNOW
sample-001411.mp3,AND THATS ARE A POWER OF LOVE COMES IN
sample-001412.mp3,THEY WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GOL HIS COMPANION ANSWERED
sample-001413.mp3,HE WANTED TO SAY SO TO THE ALCHEMIST BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF THE MAN
sample-001414.mp3,FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
sample-001415.mp3,EVEN ME I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF OTHER WOMEN SINCE I MET THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER
sample-001416.mp3,SO WHAT IS SALEM LIKE HE ASKED TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF CLUE
sample-001417.mp3,HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
sample-001418.mp3,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
sample-001419.mp3,THE DESERT DIDN'T ANSWER HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS
sample-001420.mp3,JANET ROGER DIED THREE MONTHS AGO
sample-001421.mp3,AND IN THAT WAY THE MONTHS PASSED
sample-001422.mp3,WHAT WOULD USE E TO GIVING THEM A JOINT INTERVIEW
sample-001423.mp3,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MODELS IN IT AND SO ON
sample-001424.mp3,HE REMEMBERED WHAT THE OLD MAN HAD SAID ABOUT OFFERING SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T NOUMA HAVE YET
sample-001425.mp3,WE COULD GET TO THE PYRAMIDS BY TOMORROW SAID THE OUR TAKING THE MONEY
sample-001426.mp3,THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ALCHEMIST HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENT
sample-001427.mp3,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-001428.mp3,BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GOT INTO BATTLE
sample-001429.mp3,HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEARBY
sample-001430.mp3,MAYBE WE'RE ALL THAT WAY THE BOY MUSED
sample-001431.mp3,BUT FINALLY HE AGREED THAT THE BOY WHO SPOKE BETTER RABIC THAN HE SHOULD DO SO
sample-001432.mp3,PEOPLE LDO SAY STRENGEOUS THINGS SAID BOBY SOL
sample-001433.mp3,LET'S GO AND HAVE SOME LUNCH SAID THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
sample-001434.mp3,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
sample-001435.mp3,NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HOLI CAME BACK LATE FROM THE OFFICE
sample-001436.mp3,I WANT ADOLP THE WORTH OF YOU
sample-001437.mp3,THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
sample-001438.mp3,THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS MACKSACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANK SOME
sample-001439.mp3,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
sample-001440.mp3,DONT SHARE YOUR OPINIONS SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS LISTENING
sample-001441.mp3,I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT DREAMS SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-001442.mp3,BENJAMIN WAS SNACKING ON STRIPS OF BACON
sample-001443.mp3,THEY SPOKE ABOUT MIRECULARY SALT DRAGONS AND KINGS AND HE DOEDN'T UNDERSTAND THE ENY OF IT
sample-001444.mp3,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
sample-001445.mp3,BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
sample-001446.mp3,YOU MAY KISS MY HAND
sample-001447.mp3,I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DOT OF LIGHT
sample-001448.mp3,THE MONK LAUGHED WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
sample-001449.mp3,ALL YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS TO BE SINCERE
sample-001450.mp3,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
sample-001451.mp3,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
sample-001452.mp3,THE SUN SOGHT ABOUT IT AND DECIDED TO SHINE MORE BRIGHTLY
sample-001453.mp3,THAT TOMIS LIKE THERE PUT OLWIY
sample-001454.mp3,THE BOY BROUGHT HIS HORSE CLOSER
sample-001455.mp3,AND SO DO I

sample-001457.mp3,AND SHOULDNO DAY BE GARNISHED
sample-001458.mp3,WELL WHY DON'T WE GO THERE RIGHT NOW THE BOY ASKED
sample-001459.mp3,MY KEYBOARD IS FILLED WITH DUST
sample-001460.mp3,HE SHOULD RESPECT TRADITION
sample-001461.mp3,THIS SMANTOPTOMY MOVEMENT COSTS YOU FORTUNE
sample-001462.mp3,I THOUGHT THE INSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sample-001463.mp3,IT MADE ME VERY DEPRESSED
sample-001464.mp3,IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
sample-001465.mp3,I AM IN SEARCH OF THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AMONG OTHER THINGS
sample-001466.mp3,MR LEE CAN'T BE BOTHERED NOW
sample-001467.mp3,THAT'S A GOOD IDEA
sample-001468.mp3,THEY RAN TO THE KITCHEN AT THE BACK OF THE MONASTERY
sample-001469.mp3,SOME WENT AWAY WHILE I WAS THERE AND OTHER PEOPLE CAME
sample-001470.mp3,HOW DID YOU LEARN TO READ THE GIRL ASKED AT ONE POINT
sample-001471.mp3,AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
sample-001472.mp3,YOU'VE HINTED IT OFTEN ENOUGH
sample-001473.mp3,NOW I WILL DRIFT GENTLY OFF TO DREAMLAND
sample-001474.mp3,YOU CAN'T STOP FOR A THING NOW
sample-001475.mp3,WHO'S GOT THE ROOM NEXT TO HERS
sample-001476.mp3,YOU'LL HAVE TO WAKE HIM UP
sample-001477.mp3,WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING
sample-001478.mp3,IT'S NOT GOING VERY FAR THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE HORSEMAN
sample-001479.mp3,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-001480.mp3,SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UNSCREWING THE TOP
sample-001481.mp3,THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
sample-001482.mp3,THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
sample-001483.mp3,AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHEMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS
sample-001484.mp3,THEN A MAN APPROACHED
sample-001485.mp3,JUST HANDLING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
sample-001486.mp3,BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE IN EITHER MY PAST OR MY FUTURE
sample-001487.mp3,I WENT TO STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sample-001488.mp3,BUT WHERE ARE THE HOUSES
sample-001489.mp3,ISN'T IT JUST BEAUTIFUL
sample-001490.mp3,THE CARAVAN WOULD BE VERY LUCKY TO REACH THE OASIS

sample-001493.mp3,THE BOY WANTED TO TAKE HER HAND
sample-001494.mp3,I HAD THERE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH DREAM AGAIN
sample-001495.mp3,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
sample-001496.mp3,THE SAME HAND THAT HAD BRANDISHED O THE SOLD NOW HELD A WHIP
sample-001497.mp3,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
sample-001498.mp3,IT'S THE OTHER FOREIGN THE ENGLISHMAN

sample-001504.mp3,I'M GOING WITH YOU THE BOY SAID
sample-001505.mp3,THE EMERALD TAMLET IS A DIRECT PASSAGE TO THE SAL OF THE WORLD
sample-001506.mp3,AND AT THAT I TOLD HIM AND HE TOOK MY PLACE

sample-001520.mp3,THE CATERPILLAR RESPONDED WITH A NOD
sample-001521.mp3,WHAT'LL I TELL HIM
sample-001522.mp3,THE SOB FOLKS WERE TAKING DOWN THEIR SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE ROPPNING THEIR BEDROOM WINDOWS

sample-001852.mp3,SINCE THEN I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANOTHER ONE
sample-001853.mp3,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sample-001854.mp3,IT WAS FAINTLY MARKED WITH TRANSVERSE STRIPES AND SLIGHTLY FLATTENED FROM THE PERFECT ROUND
sample-001855.mp3,WE'VE GOT TO PRODUCE A SHOW NOW
sample-001856.mp3,BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
sample-001857.mp3,THE ALARM WAS SET FOR TWENTY PAST THREE
sample-001858.mp3,I WAS IMPATIENT TO SEE IT OPENED
sample-001859.mp3,WHAT DO THEY WANT

sample-001881.mp3,I DO THE BEST I CAN TO HELP
sample-001882.mp3,IT'S NOT A BATTLE OF GOOD AGAINST EVIL
sample-001883.mp3,THAT'S WHAT I WAS SENT DOWN FOR
sample-001884.mp3,IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND
sample-001885.mp3,BUT I'M GOING IN SEARCH OF MY TREASURE THE BOY SAID
sample-001886.mp3,SOMETHING OLDER THAN HUMANITY MORE ANSEVE THAN DETHER

sample-001898.mp3,THEY FILLED THREE SACKS
sample-001899.mp3,IF I COULD I'D WRITE A HUGE ENCYCLOPEDIA JUST ABOUT THE WORDS LUCK AND COINCIDENCE
sample-001900.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN DIDN'T ANSWER HIM DIRECTLY
sample-001901.mp3,MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE THEY MOVED AROUND SO MUCH
sample-001902.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN SAID NOTHING IF WEARAT EN THE TECOMT
sample-001903.mp3,THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN READERS EXPECTATIONS CREATED BY THE TEXT AND THE REAL BEHAVIOR SHOULD BE RESOLVED
sample-001904.mp3,HE DID FIND IT SOON AFTER DAWN NOT FAR FROM THE SAND PITS
sample-001905.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST ERASED THE CIRCLE IN THE SAND AND THE SNAKE SLITHERED AWAY AMONG THE ROCKS

sample-001920.mp3,BUT JUST BEFORE LUNCHTIME A BOY STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE SHOP
sample-001921.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN HAD BEEN PROFOUNDLY IMPRESSED BY THE STORY
sample-001922.mp3,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-001923.mp3,THE MORNING POST IS NOT OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE OR HIDING CRIMINALS
sample-001924.mp3,SHE PROBABLY WORKED IT OUT IN ADVANCE
sample-001925.mp3,ABOUT TIME ONE OF YOU LUNKHEAD SAID IT

sample-001931.mp3,THIS MAN'S GOING TO JUMP AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE
sample-001932.mp3,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sample-001933.mp3,THE STRANGER SEEMED SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER
sample-001934.mp3,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MOST FAMILIAR FEATURES
sample-001935.mp3,THE DESERT DIDN'T ANSWER HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS
sample-001936.mp3,I WANT MY BABY TO LOOK LIKE YOU
sample-001937.mp3,THEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD BEEN DISTRACTED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SORE
sample-001938.mp3,TODAY I UNDERSTAND SOMETHING I DIDN'T SEE BEFORE EVERY BLESSING IGNORED BECOMES A CURSE
sample-001939.mp3,IT WAS GLARINGLY HOT NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY NOR A BREATH OF WIND
sample-001940.mp3,WELL HE FOR ABOUT THAT THE OLD MAN SAID

sample-001948.mp3,THE TOB HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
sample-001949.mp3,WHEN HE SAW HENDERSON IN HIS GARDEN HE COLLED OVER THE FENCE AND MADE HIMSELF UNDERSTOOD
sample-001950.mp3,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sample-001951.mp3,AND I THINK IT'S TERRIFIC
sample-001952.mp3,HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS
sample-001953.mp3,ONCE YOU GET INTO THE DESERT THERE'S NO GOING BACK SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sample-001954.mp3,JUST TELL THEM MARGE SANT YOU
sample-001955.mp3,IT HELPED ME TO TRUST IN PEOPLE THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED
sample-001956.mp3,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
sample-001957.mp3,THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FARIN COUNTRY

sample-001968.mp3,BUT HIS HORROT WAS SPEAKING OF OTHER THINGS
sample-001969.mp3,ALL THAT TIME THE MARTIANS WAS HAV BEEN GETTING READY
sample-001970.mp3,NIGHT FELL AND AN ASSORTMENT OF FIGHTING MEN AND MERCHANTS ENTERED AND EXITED THE TENT

sample-002239.mp3,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE
sample-002240.mp3,IT'S LIKE THE CAMEL DRIVER SAID 'EAT WHEN IT'S TIME TO EAT
sample-002241.mp3,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TALKING
sample-002242.mp3,I HAVE HAD THE SAME DREAM TWICE HE SAID
sample-002243.mp3,ONLY REALIZED THIT HAD BEEN DESTRUCTIVE FOR A FEW MOMENTS LOOKING AT THE SWORD
sample-002244.mp3,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
sample-002245.mp3,THEN SUDDENLY HE NOTICED IT WITH A START
sample-002246.mp3,IF I HAD TOLD YOU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THE PYRAMIDS
sample-002247.mp3,HE REMEMBERED WHAT THE OLD MAN SAID BUT OFFENING SOMETHING HE DIDN'T HAVEN HAVE YET

sample-002260.mp3,MY TAXDAR LOVE PAY FOR THE OF ITS SCHROOL PROMS
sample-002261.mp3,A LINE OF FLAME HIGH CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE
sample-002262.mp3,I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY
sample-002263.mp3,WHY WAS IT THAT HE WANTED THE BOY TO SERVE AS HIS INSTRUMENT
sample-002264.mp3,NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE TWO TRAVELERS
sample-002265.mp3,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-002266.mp3,WHERE'S THE OLD GOAD
sample-002267.mp3,THEY RODE FOR THE ENTIRE DAY

sample-002276.mp3,BUT THE BOY NEVER TOOK HIS EYE OFF HIS NEW FRIEND
sample-002277.mp3,THAT GONNA BE GENTLE TO SID ME
sample-002278.mp3,HALF AN HOUR LATER HIS SHOVEL HIT SOMETHING SOLID

sample-002280.mp3,HE HAD NOT A CENT IN HIS POCKET BUT HE HAD FATE
sample-002281.mp3,HE THOUGHT THAT WITH SOME PATIENCE HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO TRANSFORM EVERY THING INTO GOWRD
sample-002282.mp3,THE BOY WAS STRONG AND WANTED TO RETALIATE BUT HE WAS IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY
sample-002283.mp3,HE ALMOST BEGAN TO TELL ABOUT HIS TREASURE BUT DECIDED NOT TO DO SO
sample-002284.mp3,IT WAS A PLEASANT CHANGE FROM TALKING TO HIS SHEEP
sample-002285.mp3,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
sample-002286.mp3,THE MONA IS UNIMPORTANT
sample-002287.mp3,THE POLICE FINALLY MANAGED TO GET HIM OUT OF THE PARK

sample-002293.mp3,THO TRIBAL CHEFTAIN CALLED FOR THE BOY AND PRESENTED HIM WITH FIFTY PIECES OF GOLD
sample-002294.mp3,NEXT TIME WE'RE GOING TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY

sample-002298.mp3,PEOPLE SAW ME COMING AND WELCOMED ME HE THOUGHT
sample-002299.mp3,I'M AFRAID THAT IF MY DREAM IS REALIZED I'LL HAVE NO REASON TO GO ON LIVING
sample-002300.mp3,THE THINK ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
sample-002301.mp3,VENUS IS FAR TOO HOT FOR EXPLORATION
sample-002302.mp3,OGILVY TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
sample-002303.mp3,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sample-002304.mp3,THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP
sample-002305.mp3,AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY
sample-002306.mp3,AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHEMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS
sample-002307.mp3,THIS PUTS ME IN A PECULIAR HOLE

sample-002315.mp3,BETWEEN ROAST BEEF AND POTATOES HOW CAN WE LOSE
sample-002316.mp3,IT WAS A COBRA WHOSE VENOM COULD KILL A PERSON IN MINUTES
sample-002317.mp3,I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE ANY WAY
sample-002318.mp3,WHENEVER HE SAW THE SEA OR A FIRE HE FELL SILENT IMPRESSED BY THEIR ELEMENTAL FORCE
sample-002319.mp3,HOW'D YOU HAPPEN TO FALL IN
sample-002320.mp3,THE OMENS WILL BEGIN INSISTENTLY TO SPEAK OF IT AND YOU'LL TRY TO IGNORE THEM
sample-002321.mp3,THE STEEL OF ITS BLADE GLITTERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
sample-002322.mp3,I FIND THE OTHER ARGUMENT DUPIOUS
sample-002323.mp3,THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
sample-002324.mp3,IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
sample-002325.mp3,YOU HAVE BEEN A REAL BLESSING TO ME

sample-002332.mp3,I DON'T LIKE COCONUTS
sample-002333.mp3,THEN THE THING CAME UPON HIM IN A FLASH
sample-002334.mp3,THEN THE OLD MAN BEGAN TO INSPECT THE SHEEP AND HE SAW THAT ONE WAS LAME
sample-002335.mp3,AN ASA MAYBE YOU BUIT AVID
sample-002336.mp3,I WISHED I HAD A LIGHT TO SMOKE MINE
sample-002337.mp3,THERE WASN'T MUCH IMPETUS TO FINISH OUR CHORES

sample-002339.mp3,MY MOTHER JUST CALLED YOU
sample-002340.mp3,THE WAR IS GOING TO END SOMEDAY THE GIRL SAID
sample-002341.mp3,MAIL IS NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

sample-002355.mp3,WHEN I HAD MY SHEEP I WAS HAPPY AND I MADE THOSE AROUND ME HAPPY
sample-002356.mp3,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-002357.mp3,BECAUSE THE CRYSTAL WAS DIRTY

sample-002469.mp3,LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
sample-002470.mp3,IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELED BY FIRWORD WITH ITS TRANSPARENT FLASK HIDDEN ON TOP
sample-002471.mp3,I DIDN'T FALL IN
sample-002472.mp3,CAN I AT LEAST KEEP THE ONION SOUP
sample-002473.mp3,HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
sample-002474.mp3,THERE WAS A THUD LIKE THE FALL OF A GREAT MASS
sample-002475.mp3,AMONG THESE PEOPLE WERE A COUPLE OF CYCLISTS A GARDENER I EMPLOYED SOMETIMES AND A GIRL CARRYING A BABY
sample-002476.mp3,WHO DO YOU FEEL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT
sample-002477.mp3,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
sample-002478.mp3,IT WAS A FATAL JEK FLYING BETWEEN THE BOLDENS
sample-002479.mp3,KEEP YOUS SHIRT ON
sample-002480.mp3,THE POLICE FINALLY MANAGED TO GET HIM OUT OF THE PAWK
sample-002481.mp3,SOMEBODY PUSHED AGAINST ME AND I ALMOST FELL INTO THE DITCH
sample-002482.mp3,SO WHAT IS SALEM LIKE HE ASKED TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF CLUE
sample-002483.mp3,FROM THEN ON THE BOY UNDERSTOOD HIS HEART
sample-002484.mp3,THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE SIGN AN ERS TOO LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
sample-002485.mp3,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS

sample-002489.mp3,I COULDNT WORK IN THE CITY
sample-002490.mp3,HE JUST TOOK OVER THE BANK
sample-002491.mp3,THE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER WAS SURE THAT SHE HAD PROBABLY MARRIED
sample-002492.mp3,IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
sample-002493.mp3,BUT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS EXULTANT
sample-002494.mp3,THERE MUST BE A LANGUAGE THAT DOESN'T DEPEND ON WORDS THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-002495.mp3,THE OUTOR'S ATTENTIC FACIAL EXPRESSION WAS CONVINCING THE JURY
sample-002496.mp3,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME IWARM THE CLOUD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN

sample-002498.mp3,THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH THE HORSE
sample-002499.mp3,AND GOT IT OUT AS SOON AS HE CAN
sample-002500.mp3,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYLE BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
sample-002501.mp3,THE BOY PROMISED HIMSELF THAT WHEN HE RETURNED FROM EGYPT HE WOULD BUY THAT SWORD
sample-002502.mp3,I DON'T KNOW WHY THEE THINGS HAVE TO BE TRANSMITTED BY WORD OF MORTH HE THOUGHT
sample-002503.mp3,AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING
sample-002504.mp3,IN ANY CASE IT'S GOODFORT YOU'VE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE
sample-002505.mp3,BUT PAKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERD
sample-002506.mp3,BUT YOU'LL LOVE HER AND SHE'LL RETURN YOUR LOVE
sample-002507.mp3,IT SHOULD PROVIDE RESULTS COMPARABLE TO THE STATE OF THE ART
sample-002508.mp3,THERE WAS NO NEED TO INQURESON THEN THE ARABIST SIMPLY CONFISCATED THE HORACES
sample-002509.mp3,WHAT WE NEED IS FIREWORKS
sample-002510.mp3,CAN I GO NOW

sample-002512.mp3,IT SEEMED AS IF WHAT THE OLD KING HAD CALLED BEGINNER'S LUCK WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING
sample-002513.mp3,AS JENNIFER WALKED DOWN THE ASLE SHE WONDERED IF SHE HAD MADE A MISTAKE
sample-002514.mp3,WHAT ARE YOU DOING AROUND HERE

sample-002526.mp3,THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
sample-002527.mp3,THE JACKET HAD A PURPOSE AND SODIT THE BAY
sample-002528.mp3,I CAN ALWAYS GO ABACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-002529.mp3,IT RATTLED MENACINGLY
sample-002530.mp3,THE OLD MAN LEAFED THROUGH THE BROOK AND FELL TO READING A PAGE HE CAME TO
sample-002531.mp3,I STILL SAY THAT THIS DRONDO PERSON IS A MOTH
sample-002532.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS UNABLE TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT
sample-002533.mp3,I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-002534.mp3,SOME OF THE GREY ASH WAS FALLENG OFF THE CIRCULAR EDGE
sample-002535.mp3,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE DURING THE BLACKMITH WITH PATCHES OF GUINEL CREMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
sample-002536.mp3,I WANT THEM BOTH ARRESTED
sample-002537.mp3,HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE DIDN'T
sample-002538.mp3,NOT UNTIL THE MOON WAS HIGH DID THE ALCHEMIST RIDE INTO VIEW
sample-002539.mp3,OF COURSE THE TWO WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
sample-002540.mp3,I CAN'T THINK OF ANY REASON WHY SHE WAS KILLED
sample-002541.mp3,BUY TAX DOLLARS PAY FOR THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOL PRONGS
sample-002542.mp3,THE WEATHER FORECAST FOR THIS WEEK DIDN'T LOOK GOOD AT ALL

sample-002547.mp3,HE SAID TO FLOAT AWAY TO HAPPY LAND ON THE BUBBLES
sample-002548.mp3,THE FIRST RULE OF DON'T FIGHT CLUB IS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
sample-002549.mp3,UNTIL THEN HE HAD CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
sample-002550.mp3,IT LEFT A GREENISH STREAK THAT GLOWED FOR SOME SECONDS
sample-002551.mp3,THEY WERE KNOWN AS SEERS AND THEY WERE HELD IN FEAR BY WOMEN AND THE ELDERLY
sample-002552.mp3,THE SNOW BLASTED ALONG THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
sample-002553.mp3,A LITTLE LEMON GRASS SHOULD FRESHEN IT UP
sample-002554.mp3,AS WAS MECCA FOR THE MERCHANT

sample-002567.mp3,I DON'T KNOW THE DESERT THAT WELL YET
sample-002568.mp3,THE TRAINLINES PROVIDED AN EASY PATH TO FOLLOW
sample-002569.mp3,THE BOY WAS SAD AS HE LEFT HER THAT DAY

sample-002588.mp3,BUT HE KEPT QUIET BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD WHAT THE ALCHEMIST SAID TO THE MONK
sample-002589.mp3,BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED

sample-002602.mp3,THE HORIZON WAS TINGED WITH RED AND SUDDENLY THE SUN APPEARED
sample-002603.mp3,IN ORDER TO FIND THE TREASURE YOU WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THE OMENS
sample-002604.mp3,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-002605.mp3,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sample-002606.mp3,THE SNAKE FOUGHT FRANTICALLY MAKING HISSING SOUNDS THAT SHATTERED THE SILENCE OF THE DESERT

sample-002638.mp3,IN HIS HAND HE GRASPED A SNAKE BY THE TILE
sample-002639.mp3,BUT THE BOY WAS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT THEM
sample-002640.mp3,WE'VE STILL GOT TWO BUCKS LEFT
sample-002641.mp3,WHEN YOU START TO EAT LIKE THIS SOMETHING IS THE MATTER
sample-002642.mp3,IT WAS BUNCHED UP AND HE HARDLY THOUGHT OF IT FOR A LONG TIME

sample-002651.mp3,AND THE SOLID PART WAS CALLED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
sample-002652.mp3,GET THE GOVERNOR ON THE PHRONE

sample-002660.mp3,IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT OU DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
sample-002661.mp3,BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALREADY LOST YOUR SAVINGS TWICE
sample-002662.mp3,THIS IS CHRISTMAS EVE
sample-002663.mp3,I'M GOING AWAY HE SAID
sample-002664.mp3,THE ITALIAN GOT HO WORTS MIXED UP

sample-002677.mp3,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-002678.mp3,SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER O BE WITH A SHEEP WHO DON'T SAY ANYTHING
sample-002679.mp3,THE BUILDER PLACED THE BRICK ONTO THE PLANK OF WOOD SO IT WOULD BEND INTO SHAPE
sample-002680.mp3,IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED

sample-002682.mp3,I LEARNED HOW TO CARE FOR SHEEP AND I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN HOW THAT'S DONE
sample-002683.mp3,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
sample-002684.mp3,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR
sample-002685.mp3,I FEEL I OUGHT TO TAKE CARE OF HER
sample-002686.mp3,SOME DO COME BACK
sample-002687.mp3,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
sample-002688.mp3,SOMETHING BRIGHT REFLECTED FROM HIS CHEST WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT THE BOY WAS MOMENTARILY BLINDED
sample-002689.mp3,I THOUGHT TONIGHT I'D PUT MISS KELLI THERE
sample-002690.mp3,THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
sample-002691.mp3,BUT YOU WILL LOVE HER AND SHA'LL RETURN YOUR LOVE
sample-002692.mp3,AS THEY MOVED ALONG THE BOY TRIED TO LISTEN TO HIS HEART
sample-002693.mp3,EVIDENTLY WE'RE THE FLOOR SHOW

sample-002695.mp3,I WAS SCARED BUT WASTED NO TIME IN GOING OUT AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TO THE SAND PITS
sample-002696.mp3,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sample-002697.mp3,THE ALCHEMIST KNOCKED ON THE GATE OF THE MONASTERY
sample-002698.mp3,I HAD THAT FRIGHT HERE

sample-002710.mp3,THE LEVEL GROUND WAS BLACKENED AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEVE AND IT WAS STILL GIVING OFF SMOKE
sample-002711.mp3,BUT THE ALCHEMIST CONTINUED TO LOOK TO THE HORIZON
sample-002712.mp3,WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE
sample-002713.mp3,I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
sample-002714.mp3,WHAT AM I GOING TO DO

sample-002717.mp3,TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR DREAM SAID THE WOMAN
sample-002718.mp3,SO THE WIND BLEW WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH AND THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH SAND
sample-002719.mp3,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
sample-002720.mp3,WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING
sample-002721.mp3,HOW LONG IS IT
sample-002722.mp3,THEY EAT LUNCH TOGETHER OFTEN BUT DON'T REALLY TALK OUTSIDE THE OFFICE
sample-002723.mp3,THE BOY SAID NOTHING
sample-002724.mp3,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
sample-002725.mp3,NOW LET'S SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU PROTEST
sample-002726.mp3,THE GITER BROKE ND SHE COULDN'T PLAY ANYMORE
sample-002727.mp3,THE MEN FELL INTO AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION

sample-002732.mp3,LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN
sample-002733.mp3,THE CLOCK WAS SLIGHTLY ASQEW
sample-002734.mp3,IT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL IF MY WEBBROWSER COULD SYNCRONIZE ALL O ITS PREFERENCES NOT JUST SOME
sample-002735.mp3,THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING
sample-002736.mp3,IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
sample-002737.mp3,HE QUICKLY PULLED HIS HANDS AWAY
sample-002738.mp3,TON OLIVER AND JOIN OPATY
sample-002739.mp3,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
sample-002740.mp3,THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS
sample-002741.mp3,THE BOY HEARD NOTHING
sample-002742.mp3,IN A WEEKS TIME WE ARE GOING TO AMERICA
sample-002743.mp3,THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-002744.mp3,HE HEARD A MUFFLED GRATING SOUND AND SAW THE BLACK MARK JERK FORWARD AN INCH OR SO
sample-002745.mp3,WHAT'LD BE NEXT TO HIM FIVE MINUTES AGO WAS NOW AT THE OTHER SAD

sample-002751.mp3,THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
sample-002752.mp3,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER
sample-002753.mp3,I DIDN'T FALN IN
sample-002754.mp3,I WASN'T BORN YESTERDAY
sample-002755.mp3,I GET THIRTY DOLLARS A WEEK
sample-002756.mp3,HE STARTED TO READ THE BOOK HE HAD BOUGHT

sample-003150.mp3,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sample-003151.mp3,WITH EVERY DAY THAT PASSED THE BOY'S HEART BECAME MORE AND MORE SILENT
sample-003152.mp3,HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO SEE IF THE WOMAN KNEW WHAT THE EGYPTIAN PYRABIDS WERE
sample-003153.mp3,THE DAY WAS HOT AND THE WINE WAS REPRESSING
sample-003154.mp3,MOST OF THEM WERE STARRING QUIETLY AT THE BIG TABLE

sample-003182.mp3,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING
sample-003183.mp3,BECAUSE FOR HIM YOUARE A GREENFIELD FROM WHICH HE ALWAYS RETURNS WITH GAME

sample-003199.mp3,THAT'S WHY I FEEL THAT I DESERVE A PART OF WHAT YOU FIND
sample-003200.mp3,AND HE WASN'T FARING MUCH BETTER

sample-003227.mp3,I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY
sample-003228.mp3,WE ARE OBLIGED AT LEAST ONCE IN OUR LIVES TO VISIT THE HOLY CITY OF MECCA
sample-003229.mp3,THE BOY WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT HIS FRIEND HAD SIMPLY BECOME SEPARATED FROM HIM BY ACCIDENT

sample-003231.mp3,THE BOY WAS STARTLED
sample-003232.mp3,THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST'S TENT WITH THE HORSE
sample-003233.mp3,HE STOOD SILENT AND MOTIONLESS REGARDING ME
sample-003234.mp3,I'M BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT
sample-003235.mp3,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
sample-003236.mp3,IT WAS JUST THAT HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT WAS MEAN

sample-003272.mp3,THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES AND RODE OUT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT
sample-003273.mp3,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS

sample-003311.mp3,I HOPE IT WORKS
sample-003312.mp3,THEY STOOD THERE LOOKING AT THE MOON
sample-003313.mp3,THE CAMEL DRIVER THOUGH SEEMED NOT TO BE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE THREAT OF WAR
sample-003314.mp3,IT'S TOO BAD THAT HE'S QUICKLY GOING TO FORGET MY NAME HE THOUGHT
sample-003315.mp3,THE WAR CONTINUED AND AT TIMES THE WIND CARRIED THE SUIT THICKLY SMELLERBLED
sample-003316.mp3,I CAN CLEAN UP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
sample-003317.mp3,THE FACT THAT THE TWO HOURS HAD STRETCHED INTO AN ENTIREER NID MATAL

sample-003319.mp3,HE HOPED THAT HE WOULD BE SOMEONE AS CAPABLE AS HIS PREVIOUS APPRENTICE
sample-003320.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN ASKED IF THEY WERE IN DANGER
sample-003321.mp3,I KNOW VERY WELL WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
sample-003322.mp3,THE CAMEL DRIVER WAS NOT A FIGHTER AND HE HAD CONSULTED WITH SEERS
sample-003323.mp3,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
sample-003324.mp3,EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY THE SAME HAND
sample-003325.mp3,FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
sample-003326.mp3,DOES SHE HAVE THE MONEY

sample-003334.mp3,YOU WANNA TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
sample-003335.mp3,YOU CAN TRY USING AN ICERACKER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BUT THE PRECISION ISN'T QUITE HIGH ENOUGH
sample-003336.mp3,YOU HAVE ENOUGH GO TO BUY MANY SHEEP AND MANY CAMELS
sample-003337.mp3,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS

sample-003342.mp3,THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
sample-003343.mp3,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVORABILITY
sample-003344.mp3,ONE MUST PREPARE FOR IT
sample-003345.mp3,BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
sample-003346.mp3,FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
sample-003347.mp3,WHY SHOULDN'T I MAKE FATHER MY BENEFICIARY

sample-003354.mp3,HE PUT A SIGN ON THE DOL AND THEY WENT TO A SMALL CAFER NEARBY
sample-003355.mp3,THE BOY LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OVENS AN OTHER APPARATUS USED IN ALCHEMY BUT SAW NONE
sample-003356.mp3,THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLING APPEARED TO BE GOING ON 
sample-003357.mp3,THE CROW TILTED ITS HEAD AS IF IT WAS THINKING
sample-003358.mp3,EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
sample-003359.mp3,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
sample-003360.mp3,AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sample-003361.mp3,THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED

sample-003387.mp3,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sample-003388.mp3,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
sample-003389.mp3,THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK INTO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP
sample-003390.mp3,IF YOU START YOUR EMAILS WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH

sample-003399.mp3,I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE
sample-003400.mp3,TAKING THE FARY WITH AWISE CHOICE
sample-003401.mp3,THEY'RE NOT WORTH MUCH THE ENGLISHMAN ANSWERED

sample-003421.mp3,MECCA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY FROM THE PYRAMIDS
sample-003422.mp3,BUT BEFORE I DO IT I WON'T GET TONY ON IN STIRY
sample-003423.mp3,AND YOU TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
sample-003424.mp3,THE BOY WAS EMBARRASSED AND CONFESSED THAT HE HAD OBSERVED NOTHING
sample-003425.mp3,LANER JOINED BY CHARLES TO EVERYONE COULD HEAR HER SUBLIME SINGING VOICE
sample-003426.mp3,WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED HE ASKED THE ENGLISHMAN ONE NIGHT
sample-003427.mp3,DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON
sample-003428.mp3,WHY DON'T WE SEARCH THEIR ROOMS
sample-003429.mp3,THE BOY KNEW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CITY
sample-003430.mp3,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILLY
sample-003431.mp3,HE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE SHEEP WERE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAID
sample-003432.mp3,HE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AND WAS SURE THAT SHE WAD PROBABLY MARRIED
sample-003433.mp3,BUT I'M GOING TO EGYPT THE BOY SAID
sample-003434.mp3,EXPERIMENTS ARE UNCONVENCING

sample-003436.mp3,IS IT A DEAL OR ISN'T IT
sample-003437.mp3,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
sample-003438.mp3,WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
sample-003439.mp3,IT WAS HIS HEART THAT WOULD TELL HIM WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS HIDDEN
sample-003440.mp3,I'LL TAKE MINE NOW
sample-003441.mp3,THE CONCRETE WAS COVERED IN MOSS
sample-003442.mp3,IT'S THE MASTER WORK IN THE ALCHEMISTS
sample-003443.mp3,MOSIZED ATTEMPTING IT WAS MY FEAR OF FAILURE THAT FIRST KEPT ME FROM ATTEMPTING THE MASTER WORK
sample-003444.mp3,I'LL SEE YOU GET IT IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
sample-003445.mp3,WITH EVERY DAY THAT PASSED THE BOY'S HEART BECAME MORE AND MORE SILENT
sample-003446.mp3,YOU ARE WISE BECAUSE YOU OBSERVE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE THE BOY SAID
sample-003447.mp3,BUT THERE'S A TRIBAL WAR THE BOY REITERATED
sample-003448.mp3,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THIS MEANT
sample-003449.mp3,IN ANY CASE THE DESERT WAS IMPASSABLE
sample-003450.mp3,BUT HE KEPT QUIET BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD WHAT THE ALCHEMIST SAID TO THE MONK
sample-003451.mp3,HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE DIDN'T
sample-003452.mp3,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND LIFE IN THE DESERT THE BOY SAID
sample-003453.mp3,AT THAT POINT IN THEIR LIVES EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE
sample-003454.mp3,YOU GOT YOUR SEA LEGS YET
sample-003455.mp3,ON THE SECOND DAY THE BOY CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A CLIFF NEAR THE CAMP
sample-003456.mp3,WHY'D YOU WANT TO SAVE ME
sample-003457.mp3,GIVE ME THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE
sample-003458.mp3,BUT I DIDNT THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
sample-003459.mp3,BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE AND DIDN'T WANT A MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY
sample-003460.mp3,HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
sample-003461.mp3,AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY
sample-003462.mp3,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
sample-003463.mp3,THIS IS WHY ALCHEMY EXISTS THE BOY SAID
sample-003464.mp3,TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR DREAM SAID THE WOMAN
sample-003465.mp3,WE MUST STAY HIDDEN

sample-003467.mp3,I'LL BE RIGHT HERE
sample-003468.mp3,AND ASK FOR A GLASS OF WINE FOR ME
sample-003469.mp3,THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
sample-003470.mp3,BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE IN EITHER MY PAST OR MY FUTURE
sample-003471.mp3,THEN SHE FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER AND LEFT
sample-003472.mp3,EVERY PURCHASE IS A VOTE
sample-003473.mp3,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
sample-003474.mp3,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
sample-003475.mp3,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEAE
sample-003476.mp3,HE WAS MORE CONFIDENT IN HIMSELF THOUGH AND HE FELT AS THOUGH HE COULD CONQUER THE WAR

sample-003489.mp3,PLEASE DON'T MET ME
sample-003490.mp3,I'M GETTING TRIVER READY
sample-003491.mp3,AND THIS WAS NOT A BUSINESS MAN
sample-003492.mp3,HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD
sample-003493.mp3,I'LL GIVE IT A DRINK
sample-003494.mp3,AS THE CAME IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE ANYTHING
sample-003495.mp3,THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT
sample-003496.mp3,WHAT'LL IT TAKE TILL THE BANK REOPENS
sample-003497.mp3,HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
sample-003498.mp3,THAT'S TOO FAR FROM THE BEDROOM

sample-003500.mp3,THE BOY WAS SURPRISED AND THEN IRRITATED
sample-003501.mp3,WELL I'D LIKE TO SEE THEIR LAND AND SEE HOW THEY LIVE SAID THE KIZAN
sample-003502.mp3,YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER ONE OF THEM SAID
sample-003503.mp3,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT

sample-003505.mp3,FIRST THEY TRIED TO FIND HIM AN THEIR OWN
sample-003506.mp3,THE SUN WAS TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DISK
sample-003507.mp3,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED THROUGH MY MIND
sample-003508.mp3,THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS KNAPSACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANKS
sample-003509.mp3,THIS IS THE MAYOR
sample-003510.mp3,IT SEEMED AS IF WHAT THE OLD KING HAD CALLED BEGINIER'S LUCK WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING
sample-003511.mp3,YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR ME THE LAST TIME
sample-003512.mp3,I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
sample-003513.mp3,EVERYTHING'S GETTING COLD AND YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU
sample-003514.mp3,WE RETURNED TO THE CEMETERY

sample-003521.mp3,THE BOY WAS ALSO SADDENED HIS FRIEND WAS IN PURSUIT OF HIS DESTINY
sample-003522.mp3,ITS SATURDAY ITS HOT AND I REALLY WANT TO DRY THE DRY RAMEN
sample-003523.mp3,AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOF IS SOON AN ELEPHANT IN THE HOUSE
sample-003524.mp3,WHY THE SHOTS STOP AFTER THE TENT NO ONE ONERTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
sample-003525.mp3,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
sample-003526.mp3,HE HAS OTHER THINGS TO DO FIRST
sample-003527.mp3,HE PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR AND THEY WENT TO A SMALL CAFE NEARBY
sample-003528.mp3,DONT SHARE YOUR OPINION SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS LISTENING
sample-003529.mp3,O HAD THE EVERYONE HAS GARY BUSEY'S TEETH TY BEGAIN
sample-003530.mp3,AS FASTER AS I CAN
sample-003531.mp3,NOW I CAN SEE THAT IT HASN'T BEEN TOO BAD
sample-003532.mp3,IT MAY BE THE GASES OF THE FIRING THAT CAUSED THE MARTIANS INCONVENIENCE
sample-003533.mp3,THEY LOCKED THEMSELVES IN THEIR LABORATORIES AND TRIED TO VOE AS GOLD HAD
sample-003534.mp3,WE BEAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON THAT STORY
sample-003535.mp3,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
sample-003536.mp3,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS

sample-003538.mp3,NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECKPOINT
sample-003539.mp3,I NEVER SAID I'D TAKE IT
sample-003540.mp3,BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TIRED
sample-003541.mp3,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
sample-003542.mp3,THE HEADER WAS UNFIRE AND YOU COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE RISING UP SLOWLY
sample-003543.mp3,IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE
sample-003544.mp3,THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS
sample-003545.mp3,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
sample-003546.mp3,HUMMING DOWN THE BLOCK IS THE BIGGEST STEAM ROLLER I HAVE EVER SEEN
sample-003547.mp3,BUT ONLY SPEAK A WORD AND MY SERVANT WILL BE HEALED
sample-003548.mp3,WHEN I HAD MY SHEEP I WAS HAPPY AND I MADE THOSE AROUND ME HAPPY

sample-003556.mp3,SOME STORMS ARE WORTH THE WRECKAGE
sample-003557.mp3,I REMEMBER GRANDPA PALL LOOKING THROUGH WIT
sample-003558.mp3,GET MARTIN OUT OF JAIL
sample-003559.mp3,I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL BE ABLE TO PIND LIFE IN THE DESERT THE BOY THOUGHT

sample-003574.mp3,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEL MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-003575.mp3,UNTIL THEN HE CONSIDERED THE OMENS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
sample-003576.mp3,NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME
sample-003577.mp3,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
sample-003578.mp3,IT DOESN'T HAVE TO RHYME
sample-003579.mp3,HISTORY ISN'T THE SAME AS MINE NOR MIN ATHIS
sample-003580.mp3,I UNDERSTAND SHEEPTHEY'RE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
sample-003581.mp3,YOU CAN VERIFY AND REALECORD YOUR OWN RECORDINGS BEFORE SUBMITTING THET

sample-003599.mp3,HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
sample-003600.mp3,BUT THE ENGLISHMAN APPEARED NOT TO ATTACH ANY IMPORTANCE TO IT
sample-003601.mp3,I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANY
sample-003602.mp3,YOU POINT TO A TRAIL OF ANTS LEADING INTO THE HOUSE
sample-003603.mp3,IF HE EVER DECIDED TO LEAVE THEM THEY WOULD SUFFER

sample-003679.mp3,YOU'LL MARRY FATIMA AND YOU'LL WOT BE HAPPY FOR A YEAR
sample-003680.mp3,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-003681.mp3,I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING MORE
sample-003682.mp3,THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES
sample-003683.mp3,SCATTERED GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE HURRYING FROM THE DIRECTION OF WOKING

sample-003685.mp3,I'LL COVER THE METHOD I USE AND DESCRIBE SOME ALTERNATIVES
sample-003686.mp3,AND I'M CERTAIN YOU'LL FIND IT THE ALCHEMIST SAID
sample-003687.mp3,THE HOOKAHS WERE EXTINGUISHED AND THE GUADS STOOD AT ATTENTION
sample-003688.mp3,UNUGUAL HAD BEEN MADE BY IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
sample-003689.mp3,WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP OUR CLUB
sample-003690.mp3,ANOTHER PERSON WAS THERE TO HELP HIM TOWARD HIS DESTINY
sample-003691.mp3,THE CHARCOAL BURNED AWAY TO WHITE ASH
sample-003692.mp3,HE STOOD IRRESOLUTE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE PIT
sample-003693.mp3,YOU CAN'T SEE THE PLANET WITH THE NAKED EYE
sample-003694.mp3,HE SHOULD HAVE DECIDED TO BECOME A SHEPHERD THE BOY SAID
sample-003695.mp3,SHE KEEPS SAYING THAT SHE HAS NO REGRETS ABOUT MOVING BACK HOME BUT IM NOT SURE IF ITS ENTIRELY TRUE
sample-003696.mp3,DON'T THEY USUALLY KEEP THE GUN ON THE FLOOR
sample-003697.mp3,I'M AFRAID SHE'D FEEL ASHAMED TO THINK SHE HADN'T TRUSTED YOU
sample-003698.mp3,MANY PEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE SURREY AND MIDDLESEX MUST HAVE SEEN IT
sample-003699.mp3,THE OMENS WILL BEGIN INSISTENTLY TO SPEAK OF IT AND YOU'LL TRY TO IGNORE THEM
sample-003700.mp3,THERE WERE JUST DRAWINGS CODED INSTRUCTIONS AND OBSCURE TEXTS
sample-003701.mp3,COME INTO THE OFFICE A MINUTE
sample-003702.mp3,IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE
sample-003703.mp3,FRANK WAS NIGING SO THEY WERE FORCED TO LEAP HIM
sample-003704.mp3,YOU ARE WISE BECAUSE YOU OBSERVE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE THE BOY SAID
sample-003705.mp3,THERE'S ONE THAT SAYS 'EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS ONCE CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN
sample-003706.mp3,MOST OF THEM WERE STARING QUIETLY AT THE BEGITI OF HIS
sample-003707.mp3,LOOKING DOWN AT THE SPOON HE HELD THE BOY SAW THAT THE OIL WAS GONE
sample-003708.mp3,THOUSANDS OF WORKERS COMMUTE FROM THE SURROUNDINGS INTO THE CITY EACH DAY
sample-003709.mp3,THE BOY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

sample-003711.mp3,SO HE BEGAN TO WANDER THROUGH THE CITY AND FOUND HIMSELF AT THE GATES
sample-003712.mp3,IS MUCH LESS SENSITIVE TO SPURIOUS AWAKENINGS THAN THE SLEEPMODE
sample-003713.mp3,THAT'S THE REASON WHY I CAME IN FOURTH
sample-003714.mp3,WHENCE YOU GET INTO THE DESERT THERE IS NO GOING BACK SAID THE CAMEL DRIVER
sample-003715.mp3,I PROMISED THAT I WOULD MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS HE SAID TO HIMSELF

sample-003718.mp3,HE COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING A SHEPHERD
sample-003719.mp3,AND WE HAD A BITE
sample-003720.mp3,NOT EVEN A STEAK OF GUM
sample-003721.mp3,HE KNEW HE WAS STRONGER THAN HIS FRIEND
sample-003722.mp3,THE CITY WAS STILL SLEEPING
sample-003723.mp3,THAT MAKES SENSE THE ALCHEMIST' ANSWERED
sample-003724.mp3,THE ARTICLE IN THE CURRENT STATE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUBLICATION
sample-003725.mp3,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE THAT GINGERBREAD MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN HOUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
sample-003726.mp3,I LEFT HER HANGING AROUND THE AMERICAN EXPRESS
sample-003727.mp3,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO EARTH FROM OUTER SPACE
sample-003728.mp3,HER WALLS WERE COVERED WITH DARK AND SCARY SKETCHES
sample-003729.mp3,HERE I AM BETWEEN MY FLOCK AND MY TREASURE THE BOY THOUGHT

sample-003734.mp3,I'VE GOT A DESK I WANT MOVED
sample-003735.mp3,IT WAS SEEN EARLY IN THE MORNING RUSHING OVER EASTWARD
sample-003736.mp3,I DONT MIND WORKING FROM HOME MOST OF THE TIME BUT I DO MISSHAVING COLD WORKERS
sample-003737.mp3,THAT WAS THE LAW OF HOSPITALITY
sample-003738.mp3,THE BOY WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT HIS FRIEND HAD SIMPLY BECOME SEPARATED FROM HIM BY ACCIDENT
sample-003739.mp3,DID YOU SEE THE GARDEN THAT IT TOOK THE MASTER GARDENER TEN YEARS TO CREATE
sample-003740.mp3,HE DIDN'T SUDU SO WITH HIS WORDS BUT WITH SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES THAT'S THE TRICK

sample-003753.mp3,WHAT'S THIS THE END OF TIGT
sample-003754.mp3,THE BOY WAS EMBARRASSED AND CONFESSED THAT HE HAD OBSERVED NOTHING
sample-003755.mp3,AND ABOVE ALL DON'T FORGET TO FOLLOW YOUR DESTINY THROUGH TO ITS CONCLUSION
sample-003756.mp3,HAD OUR INSTRUMENTS PERMITTED IT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE TROUBLE WAY BACK WHEN
sample-003757.mp3,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TURN THEM INTO REALITY

sample-003759.mp3,WHERE ARE WE GOING
sample-003760.mp3,FOR EVERY TEN MEN DEAD AMONG YOUR ENEMIES YOU'LL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
sample-003761.mp3,HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEEK OUT THE OLD WOMAN FOR THIS
sample-003762.mp3,FROM THERE HE COULD SEE AFRICA IN THE DISTANCE
sample-003763.mp3,I DONT MIND WORKING FOR HOME MOST OF THE TIME BUT I DOOM MISHAVING COWORKERS
sample-003764.mp3,SO YOU KNOW BAD LOVE THE BOY SAID
sample-003765.mp3,ONCE YOU GET FAMILIAR WITH IT YOU WILL WANT TO USE IT FOR EVERYTHING
sample-003766.mp3,THE THOUGHT WAS SO DREADFUL TO HIM THAT HE FORGOT ABOUT THE HEAT AND WENT FORWARD
sample-003767.mp3,TO NOURISH THE FALCON
sample-003768.mp3,I LOCKED EYES WITH A FISH IN THE TANK
sample-003769.mp3,I WANT TO SEE HIM DO IT SAID THE CHIEF
sample-003770.mp3,BUT BAKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SHEPHERDS
sample-003771.mp3,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY IN THE DARK
sample-003772.mp3,YOU HAVE GIVEN UP A SERIOUS CASE OFF MY ONE YAN
sample-003773.mp3,BUT THE TRADITION ALSO SAYS THAT WE SHOULD BELIEVE THE MESSAGES OF THE DESERTS
sample-003774.mp3,AN ICEMY IT'S CALLED THE SOUL OF THE WORLD
sample-003775.mp3,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR

sample-003777.mp3,GOLD WOULD LOSE ITS VEIL
sample-003778.mp3,WE'LL LIVE TOMORROW BEFORE SUNRISE WAS THE ALCHEMIST ON EVERY SPOND

sample-003783.mp3,JUST ONE MORE TRY
sample-003784.mp3,HE WON'T LEAVE THE CIRCLE
sample-003785.mp3,LOVE IS THE FALCON'S FLIGHT OVER YOUR SONS

sample-003788.mp3,IT SPOKE OF JOURNEYS DISCOVERIES BOOKS AND CHANGE
sample-003789.mp3,I ALMOST DROPPED HIM
sample-003790.mp3,THE ACCOMMODATION WAS AFFORDABLE AND COSY
sample-003791.mp3,SO HIS HEART WAS QUIET FOR AN ENTIRE AFTERNOON
sample-003792.mp3,THE RIVER BABBLED NAMELY TO ITSELF
sample-003793.mp3,THE AIROPLANE ROSE GRACEFULLY INTO THE SKY
sample-003794.mp3,HUNDREDS MUST HAVE SEEN IT AND TAKEN IT FOR A FALLING STAR

sample-003802.mp3,WOULDN'T DO ANY GOOD
sample-003803.mp3,I THOUGHT SURE YOU'D REMEMBER ME
sample-003804.mp3,HE DECANTED THE WINE AND BEGAN TO RECOUNT THE DISTURBING STORY HE HAD BEEN TOLD
sample-003805.mp3,YOU MAY KISS MY HAND
sample-003806.mp3,AS THE SUN ROSE THE MAN BEGAN TO BEAT THE BOY

sample-003823.mp3,I'M HUNTING WITH MY FALCON THE ALCHEMIST ANSWERED
sample-003824.mp3,WHERE'S THAT AIRLINE'S BAG
sample-003825.mp3,THE PINK LOVE HEART KEYRING GLOWED
sample-003826.mp3,TEN YEARS AT THE UNIVERSITY AND HERE I AM IN A CORRAL
sample-003827.mp3,MANY PEOPLE IN BERKSHIRE SURREY AND MIDDLESEX MUST HAVE SEEN IT
sample-003828.mp3,SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET HURT
sample-003829.mp3,THE FORM OF HEAP STAT OUT  HIS VOTE ADWHILE AND ANLAWFULLY
sample-003830.mp3,THE BOY WAS BECOMING NERVOUS
sample-003831.mp3,AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
sample-003832.mp3,SOMETHING HAPPENS HERE YOU'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER LATER ON
sample-003833.mp3,AND IF IT IS
sample-003834.mp3,I FOUND A LITTLE CROWD OF ABOUT TWENTY PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE HUGE HOLE
sample-003835.mp3,I WANTED THEM TO BE A PART OF YOUR INHERITANCE
sample-003836.mp3,THE CHAIR HAD LEATHER UPHULSTERY
sample-003837.mp3,ANY STATEMENT OL THE RAD UPPRISING TOMORROW

sample-003840.mp3,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
sample-003841.mp3,ABOUT AN HOUR AGO
sample-003842.mp3,I GOT IT BACK
sample-003843.mp3,I HAVE TO FIND MEN WHO KNOWS THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE
sample-003844.mp3,WHY THE SHOTS STOPPED AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
sample-003845.mp3,BUT THAT'S THE JAIL
sample-003846.mp3,'NONA DREAMER SAID THE TICKET SELLAR TO HIS ASSISTANT WATCHING THE BOY WALK AWAY
sample-003847.mp3,HE PAID FOR THE WOOL AND ASKED THE SHEPHERD TO COME BACK THE FOLLOWING YEAR
sample-003848.mp3,IT'S NOT WHAT ENTERS MEN'S MOUTHS AT'S EVIL SAID THE ALCHEMIST
sample-003849.mp3,THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEARED AT THE ALCHEMIST PEN WITH A HORSE
sample-003850.mp3,THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE OTHERS
sample-003851.mp3,I THOUGHT THE UNTSCREWING MIGHT BE AUTOMATIC
sample-003852.mp3,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
sample-003853.mp3,I FORGOT MY HEAT
sample-003854.mp3,WHAT'S MY NAME DOING HONOR
sample-003855.mp3,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT ATAT M
sample-003856.mp3,I FEEL SICK WHAT SHOULD I DO
sample-003857.mp3,IT WAS JUST THEN HE COULDN'T GRASP WHAT IT MEANT
sample-003858.mp3,HE SAW THE BOY APPEAR FROM THE OTHER SADE OF THE DUNES
sample-003859.mp3,I TELL YOU WHAT I WILL DO
sample-003860.mp3,BUT SHE IS GONE
sample-003861.mp3,AND THEY ATTACKED AN EMPTY TENT
sample-003862.mp3,HE WAS ALARMED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED
sample-003863.mp3,YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE COMMOTION IN THAT LOCKER ROOM
sample-003864.mp3,OUGHT BUT A FLASH FOR YOU
sample-003865.mp3,DUSK WAS FALLING AS THE BOY ARRIVED WITH HIS HORD AT AN UNABANDONED CHURCH
sample-003866.mp3,COACH HAS HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU
sample-003867.mp3,THAT'S A PHILOSOPHER'S TONE AND THELIXR OF LIVE
sample-003868.mp3,WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING
sample-003869.mp3,REVENGE IS NOT MY STYR BUT OBVIOUSLY ACCIDENT WILL HAPPEN
sample-003870.mp3,THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
sample-003871.mp3,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
sample-003872.mp3,GIVING PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO CONTAMINATE THE TROOPER
sample-003873.mp3,THE BOY LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OVENS AND OTHER APPARATUS USED IN ALCHEMY BUT SAW NONE
sample-003874.mp3,YOU'VE GOT DOMETHING ON YOUR MIND
sample-003875.mp3,THE OLD MAN WORE A BREASTPLATE OF HEAVY GOLD COVERED WITH PRECIOUS STONES
sample-003876.mp3,IT MAY BE THE GASES OF THE FIRIN THAT CAUSED THE MARTIANS INCONVENIENCE
sample-003877.mp3,THEN SHE GOT OUT THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT
sample-003878.mp3,AND NOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY FATHER IS
sample-003879.mp3,THAT'S ALL I ASK
sample-003880.mp3,DO YOU KNOW HIM
sample-003881.mp3,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
sample-003882.mp3,AND I WILL BE THE POLICEMAN
sample-003883.mp3,DON'T YOU PUSH ME AROUND LIKE THAT
sample-003884.mp3,THE BOY WENT TO LOOK FOR THE ENGLISHMAN
sample-003885.mp3,THE SHEEP WILL GET USED TO MY NOT BEING THERE TOO THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-003886.mp3,IT BROUGHT HIS HEART INTO HIS MOUTH
sample-003887.mp3,I WAS EXPECTING YOU
sample-003888.mp3,THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES
sample-003889.mp3,THE DESCENT WAS DISTURBINGLY STEEP
sample-003890.mp3,WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU TWO GUYS
sample-003891.mp3,BUT WOULD YOU SAY ABOUT THAT
sample-003892.mp3,THAT WAS A LITTLE GIRL NAMED MARY HATCH
sample-003893.mp3,SHE SAT ON THE FLOOR DRINKING HER COFFEE
sample-003894.mp3,AND THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER PERFECTLY WELL
sample-003895.mp3,SHE KNOWS THAT MEN HAVE TO GO AWAY IN ORDER TO RETURN
sample-003896.mp3,OGILVERT TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD SEEN
sample-003897.mp3,WE'VE STILL GOT TWO BUCKS LEFT
sample-003898.mp3,THANK YOU VERY MUCH
sample-003899.mp3,YOU'LL ASK ME TO WHAT
sample-003900.mp3,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
sample-003901.mp3,APPARENTLY  A DUMPLINGS THAT MAKE THIS DUE TASTE SO GOOD
sample-003902.mp3,BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GO INTO BATTLE
sample-003903.mp3,SHE'S ACCUSED OF STEALING A WATCH
sample-003904.mp3,THE BOY LOOKED OUT AT THE HORIZON
sample-003905.mp3,WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP OUR CLUB
sample-003906.mp3,FROM THEN ON HE WOULD MAKE A SON DECISIONS
sample-003907.mp3,HE MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID ENCOUNTERS WITH THIEVES
sample-003908.mp3,HIS HANDS WERE APRADED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HORT
sample-003909.mp3,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO HER FROM OUTER SPACE
sample-003910.mp3,AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHEMIST
sample-003911.mp3,THEY JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW
sample-003912.mp3,FOOTPEDALS ARE ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO VOICE COMMANDS
sample-003913.mp3,THE BOY'S HEART BEGAN TO SPEAK OF FEAR
sample-003914.mp3,BUT THE KING OF SALEM HOPED DESPERATELY THAT THE BOY WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL
sample-003915.mp3,ANOTHER TRICK THE BOY THOUGHT
sample-003916.mp3,AN HGE HLE BAT BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE POJECTIREA U HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE POJECTI
sample-003917.mp3,WHEN THE BLINDING DUST HAD SETTLED A BIT THE BOY TREMBLED AT WHAT HE SAW
sample-003918.mp3,THE SECRET IS HERE IN THE PRESENT
sample-003919.mp3,SHE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A CHEAP COPY BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW
sample-003920.mp3,I'M LOOKING FOR A TREASURE SAID THE BOY AND HE IMMEDIATELY REGRETTED HAVING SAID IT
sample-003921.mp3,I'DN'T KNOW THAT VOICE ANYWHERE
sample-003922.mp3,THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
sample-003923.mp3,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTO THE TREES
sample-003924.mp3,BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
sample-003925.mp3,OTHER SERVANTS MAINTAINED THE FIRES IN THE HOOKAHS
sample-003926.mp3,WHAR IS MY FUNCTION
sample-003927.mp3,IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT
sample-003928.mp3,NEXT YOU WANT TO ENUMERATE PABS SO YOU CAN QUICKLY JUMP BETWEEN THEM
sample-003929.mp3,AND YOU'VE TOLD ME NOTHING ALONG THE WAY SAID THE BOY
sample-003930.mp3,IT'S A PRIVATE CUB OLD ONLY THE MOST DISCUITICABLE PEOPLE
sample-003931.mp3,HE WAS GOING TO MISS THE PLACE AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS HE HAD LEARNED
sample-003932.mp3,THIS REGARD MY LAS STATEMENT
sample-003933.mp3,HE RESTARTED HIS EFFORTS FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME
sample-003934.mp3,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAT ANY IDEA ABOUT GASTIMINA
sample-003935.mp3,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
sample-003936.mp3,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
sample-003937.mp3,BUT THE MARKETPLEASH WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS FAR FROM HIREND SO HE WHIPPED
sample-003938.mp3,THE SHOWER'S IN THERE
sample-003939.mp3,AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
sample-003940.mp3,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
sample-003941.mp3,I WONDER WHAT'S EATING THAT OLD MONEY GRUBBING BUZZARD ANYWAY
sample-003942.mp3,I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET PICTURES OF HER PHORM
sample-003943.mp3,I'M DYING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE
sample-003944.mp3,GET A LOAD OF THIS
sample-003945.mp3,ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY USE S PAAIRS OF KEYS
sample-003946.mp3,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
sample-003947.mp3,I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
sample-003948.mp3,YOU'D THINK IT WAS ON THE WITNESS STAND
sample-003949.mp3,WITH A BAG OF MARSHMALLOW
sample-003950.mp3,AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
sample-003951.mp3,IF SOMEONE ISN'T WHAT OTHERS WANT THEM TO BE THE OTHERS BECOME ANGRY
sample-003952.mp3,THE TENLER DIDN'T HOVE ALOG CANG
sample-003953.mp3,SAMSON BRIGHT REFLECTED FROM HIS CHEST WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT THE BOY WAS MOMANAN MOMENTARILY BLIND
sample-003954.mp3,I'LL BE BACK THE BOY SAID
sample-003955.mp3,IT'S NOT I THE WIND SPOKE ABOUT
sample-003956.mp3,THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT FLAGS UP THERE NOW
sample-003957.mp3,I HEARD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FAT
sample-003958.mp3,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FOMELOWER FEATURES
sample-003959.mp3,BUT THAT I REALIZED SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
sample-003960.mp3,EXACTLY ANSWERED THE ALCHEMIST
sample-003961.mp3,OR A MAN INTO THE WIND
sample-003962.mp3,THE BOY REMINDED THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HIDDEN TREASURE
sample-003963.mp3,NO SENSE IN GOING UP THERE
sample-003964.mp3,IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE A LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
sample-003965.mp3,ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
sample-003966.mp3,THEY HER THE SERVANTS MAINTAINED THE FIRE IN THE OOKAHS
sample-003967.mp3,AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY
sample-003968.mp3,HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURNED TO HIS MEDITATION
sample-003969.mp3,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVED THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
sample-003970.mp3,THERE DEAR IT IS SNART SOMETHING EXCLUSE YOUR TO HUMANS
sample-003971.mp3,I'LL RETURN JUST AS YOUR FATHER CAME BACK TO YOUR MOTHER HE SAID
sample-003972.mp3,THEN SHE TOOK BOTH OF HIS HANDS IN HERS AND BEGAN QUIETLY TO PLAY
sample-003973.mp3,THESE TROUSERS DON'T FIT VERY WELL
sample-003974.mp3,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
sample-003975.mp3,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
sample-003976.mp3,AFTHER ALL WHO DOESNT WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND THE CHIEF GREAT HADES
sample-003977.mp3,STRONG PASSWORDS DON'T HAVE TO BE HARD TO REMEMBER
sample-003978.mp3,ALWAYS ASK AN OBJECTIVE QUESTION
sample-003979.mp3,HE WASN'T ASKING FOR HELP
sample-003980.mp3,THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
sample-003981.mp3,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
sample-003982.mp3,THE BOY SMILED AND CONTINUED DIGGIEG
sample-003983.mp3,YOU CAN GET AROUND VERY EASILY BY TRAIN WHICH IS A VERY RELAXING AND AFFORDABLE WAY TO TRAVEL
